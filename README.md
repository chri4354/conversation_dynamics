# Conversation Dynamics
SFI Complex System Summer School project

Aim: explore the dynamics of natural language conversations into opinion space.

New Steps:
1. Translate speeches to English
2. Extract relevant speeches using keywords
3. Get exploratory plots
** Number of speeches vs time (by party, by politician)
** Length of these speeches
4. Get some basic history understanding
** Landmark votes
** Key parties/players
** Important news stories
5. Hand-label some relevant speeches to make validation set (10 per decade?)
6. Improve model
** Include wikipedia-neutral corpus into model data 
** Train models (basic ones first) 
** Test on validation data of speeches
** If good: Run model on whole dataset
