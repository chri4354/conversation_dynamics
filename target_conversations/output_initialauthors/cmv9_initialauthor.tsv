0	t3_65jy88	Milkshaketurtle79		I'm pro choice. I don't support abortion, but I support a woman's right to do as she pleases with her body. It's not my place to decide. With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it.

If we were to replace the baby with an adult, many pro lifers would say it's unfair to force someone to let somebody else feed off of your body.	0.9759525656700134	0.8593600392341614	0.18191516399383545
