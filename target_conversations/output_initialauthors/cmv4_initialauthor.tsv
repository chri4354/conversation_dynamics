"t3_5rb7bq"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\"chooses\\" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."
"t1_dd5zssz"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"Do you think the comparison to rape holds any water?"
"t1_dd65zn2"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"my argument is acting under the assumption that the life-form in the womb is equivalent to a person, and that an abortion is essentially a form of manslaughter. In this case however the killing is justified due to a person's right to protect their own interests and well being in the same way a person can defend themselves from a rapist."
"t1_dd5zp7m"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The importance of my equivocation is that in order to get the person out of you it may be necessary to use violent self defense. In regards to risk of loss of life, It's important to recognize that it isn't always obvious early in the pregnancy how dangerous the pregnancy is. Perfectly healthy women in normal pregnancies can experience life threatening complications, so the risk of death cannot be ignored."
"t1_dd65ohk"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"Rape is rarely a lethal assault, but it does cause a lot of pain and misery. An unwanted pregnancy can cause just as much pain and misery, so I think the comparison stands.In response to your second point about the kkk rally, i don't think that is a fair comparisson because the physical burden of pregnancy is actual and ongoing, unlike the kkk rally which merely suggests future danger"
"t1_dd65vso"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"my point is that both the rapist and fetus are where they are and doing what they are doing due to universal circumstances. Therefore, our consideration of a person's right to protect themselves from the effects of another person potentially being inside of them should be indifferent to their origin."
"t1_dd5zr2i"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The point of law and justice is still relevant to protect people from suffering."
"t1_dd65p9b"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"this isn't really the point I'm getting at..."
"t1_dd5w7y6"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"sure, it just means that criminals need a penal system that can either reform their behavior or separate them from vulnerable members of society. Doesn't change society's need to protect people.This logic certainly gets rid of most degrees of moral accountability, replacing it with utilitarian approaches to protect people etc."
"t1_dd66wdi"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The difference between sex and rape is that one is desired and consented and the other is not. I don't believe in blaming or lauding people for their actions because they cannot help it. I do believe in having a system of law and justice that can reduce and prevent suffering. Thus crime and justice still exists and is relevant for the sake of protecting people, regardless of the origin of crime being a person who has the freedom to act or a person who is slave to their biology and circumstance.I don't think I am calling into question Mens Rea, but I admit not fully understanding the concept. I'd like to hear more about how this is relevant."
"t1_dd66i0u"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The concept of pre-meditation is not one I have fully considered, and I'd like to hear more about it's role here.One point I'd like to make that makes the hypothetical of the \\"i am going to hurt you in the next 9 months\\" a bit off-base is that the burden of pregnancy is actual and ongoing, not hypothetically going to occur but actually occurring on a constant basis throughout the term.There is threat of immediate and ongoing pain, discomfort, nausea, weight gain, immobility etc. So i think the option of self defense is still relevant."
"t1_dd7eap2"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"As a neuroscientist, I find it very difficult to draw the line of when an embryo becomes a baby. This argument allows for abortion even if the personhood begins at conception."
"t1_dd66371"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"a pregnancy is often extremely taxing on the mother's health and emotional state. delivery of a child is extremely painful and frequently dangerous. Rape is also infrequently deadly, but very painful and emotionally taxing so the comparison stands. The bodily harm of an unwanted pregnancy and delivery of a child is comparable to the trauma of being raped."
"t1_dd673c6"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"This is probably the best response I've heard so far and comes close to CMV. I am hesitant to accept your argument because the degree of physical discomfort, and cost of a pregnancy is really hard to estimate. A pregnancy can be very painful and unpleasant and complications can be life threatening. For this reason, I still believe the suffering of an unwanted pregnancy may be enough to justify the killing."
"t1_dd73237"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"this is very good point. Kids who are bullied everyday and eventually snap back with lethal violence are usually prosecuted to the extreme extent of the law. In the sense that the mental anguish associated with unwanted pregnancy is similar to bullying, I can see how resorting to lethal violence is unjustified. However, a major difference here is that there are multiple ways to stop bullying, including parent/teacher interventions or changing school systems. The only possible ways to end the mental anguish of pregnancy is an abortion or extensive counseling to the point of changing the mother's mind about what they want to do. Since extensive therapy is a theoretical alternative to the abortion, I suppose that it should be attempted first. However, I think that there are a lot of messy details about how far therapy can go in changing the mind of the mother before it goes too far. therefore I still think that the use of lethal force as the only possible method to end the suffering of the mother is justified"
