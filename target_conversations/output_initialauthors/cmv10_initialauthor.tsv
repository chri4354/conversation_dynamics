The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\"lending\\" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."

"t1_dhagifz"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"I think this is fundamentally incorrect. The most famous defense of abortion in philosophy was Judith Jarvis Thompson's 1971 essay on bodily autonomy, which has been since expanded on by others. It made the concession that the foetus is a fully fledged human being from the moment of conception."
"t1_dhajpq3"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"I am only citing the most common philosophical defense of abortion, which has formed the basis for Roe V Wade and most subsequent discussion on this subject. It basically works with the idea that a foetus may be a human being, but it is still morally acceptable to abort it because of *bodily autonomy rights*.I am then saying that, if we accept this argument, we have to concede that parents have no moral obligations to ensure the welfare of their children, anymore than they do a total stranger. Because that's what the bodily autonomy case is saying - you don't owe the child any duty or obligation of care, so you can choose to remove it from your body even if it dies. I don't see how this doesn't extent to children as well."
"t1_dh9k0v9"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"The philosophical arguments underpinning a woman's right to choose actually granted that the foetus is a fully fledged human being from the moment of conception (specifically referring to Judith Jarvis Thompson's 1971 essay).Even if we don't grant that, I'd struggle to find many differentiating features that would suggest aborting an 18 week old foetus is completely acceptable practice, whilst neglecting a 1 week old infant till the point of death is a completely deplorable act only committed by the vilest of monsters. If we champion bodily autonomy in the former scenario, why not hold the same position for the latter?As for the issue of preventing suffering of unwanted children - shouldn't we then not only legalise child neglect but child murder? Any mother who kills her child would obviously be an unfit mother who does not want to invest any love or care into her child, so murdering it may indeed be an improvement of the child's \\"wellbeing\\"? Why is killing a foetus that will eventually suffer so much better than killing a child who is currently suffering?The womans wellbeing again, if we really take these principles to their limit, should lead to legitimising child murder."
"t1_dh9jb5g"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"Pregnant women can also rescind their parental rights once the child is born in a matter of months. Yes that means they will have to go through the pregnancy, but equally a parent would have to continue to take care of their child until the state takes it off them, which is certainly not instant. Ultimately, I think if you're using a completely black &amp; white ideological argument to support bodily autonomy in pregnancy (saying a woman should be able to rescind her obligation absolutely anytime), you have to use the same standard for parenting as a whole, in which case child neglect should be legal. If you're starting to throw pragmatic elements into it, then its only fair you do the same for pregnancy/abortion, in which case I can only conclude that abortion shouldn't be allowed."
"t1_dh9ksss"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"However, less of a big deal than actively crushing a foetus to pieces till it is dead, no?"
"t1_dh9kpy3"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"Why does she have to ensure that, though? Like I said, you are bringing a pragmatic element in here: A parent can rescind their obligation to take care of their child as it is their choice, but since neglecting it outright wouldn't be a very nice thing to do, they should make sure it is taken care of first.I don't see how it's any different to say that a woman can rescind her right to take care of a foetus as it is her choice, but since crushing it with a pair of forceps and pulling it piece by piece out of her body isn't very nice, she should wait till the foetus can survive outside her and then give it to someone else to care for."
"t1_dhakgey"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"Bodily autonomy is not conditional on options, at least not when you take an absolute stance on it like pro-choicers do. You can choose to either provide for another individual or not.Bodily autonomy is also not conditional on suffering. Otherwise, we could force people to donate kidneys to people who were suffering from renal failure. A right to do what you want with your body is not affected by the circumstances of other individuals around you."
