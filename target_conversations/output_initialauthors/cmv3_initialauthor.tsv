"t3_5shhx3"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I'm making this CMV because I've noticed that my views on abortion don't really line up with either of the two main viewpoints on it (although they're much closer to a pro-choice viewpoint than a pro-life one). This isn't so much one specific view as it is a collection of related views regarding abortion.I'll specifically list the things that I believe and the things that I don't believe. I think it's good to address both sides because we live in a world where a simple sentence like \\"I support gun rights\\" has people immediately jumping to conclusions about your views on everything from race relations and gay marriage to economic standpoints and foreign policy. Addressing both sides helps to avoid people reaching incorrect conclusions.Important note: For the purposes of this discussion I am writing this with the assumption in mind that a fetus at any point in development is equivalent to a human life. I **do not** believe this and I will explain my reasons for making this assumption in the \\"Things I don't believe\\" section.Also, I am from the U.S.A. and I will be writing this with specific regards to the United States. When I say 'government', 'society', etc. I mean the U.S. government or U.S. society.**Things that I believe***View*: Abortions help society.*Reasoning*: There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies. For starters, every human who is born takes up a lot of resources, and produces a lot of pollution. The average American is responsible for roughly 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita)). Essentially, humans are bad for the environment so less humans is a good thing if we consider climate change to be important.Additionally, unwanted babies are more likely to grow up in bad situations (since they were unwanted), and are more likely to become criminals detrimental to society, or if not criminals then people on welfare which is also detrimental to society. Now yes, it is possible that some aborted baby would have grown up to be the next Einstein. But since it is more likely that they will end up being detrimental to society, I see no reason why we should assume that the less likely of two outcomes will happen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Women of any age, citizenship status, etc. should be able to get an abortion from any abortion clinic for free, no questions asked.*Reasoning*: In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 ([source](https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2014/06/much-abortion-cost-draft-theresas/)). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. If you oppose a doctor simply informing their patient of the facts, then you oppose spreading knowledge and have no place in any sort of philosophical discussion. If you still do not like the fact that the woman may be more likely to choose abortion when they are more aware of the facts, then maybe you should rethink your position on the matter because when people gain knowledge on the subject they become more likely to disagree with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.*Reasoning*: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.Also not that this is fundamentally different from things such as breastfeeding or a mother simply providing food for her child. Breast milk serves no purpose to the mother, and the nutrients stored in food do not belong to anyone until they consume that food. In this way, a fetus in the womb truly does steal nutrients from the mother. A baby does not steal nutrients from the mother, but rather uses nutrients that were either useless to the mother (breastmilk), or provided by the mother as a gift and therefore never the mother's in the first place.----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.*Reasoning*: This point will probably cause the most controversy. Many people will disagree with this because late in the pregnancy, the fetus would be able to survive on its own if it were surgically removed from the woman in the proper manner. However, I believe that just because it would be able to survive on its own does not change the fact that it is still essentially a parasite and the woman still deserves the right to remove that parasite from her body. The fetus, while in the womb, is still feeding off the nutrients of the mother (regardless of whether or not it could survive outside the womb), and therere should be treated as a parasite.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Things that I do not believe***View*: Women should be forced to have abortions.*Reasoning*: This one is obvious but it must be stated, I do not believe that any woman, for any reason, should EVER be forced into having an abortion. Encouraging them is fine, informing them is fine, forcing them is not.--------------------------------------*View*: A fetus's life is equivalent to a human life*Reasoning*: As I mentioned earlier, I want this discussion to be had with the assumption in mind that fetus's are equivalent to human lives. However, I do not believe this is true. The reason I wish for this to be the assumption is that pro-lifers tend to get hung up on this which I know will lead to a meaningless discussion because I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were **uneqivocally proven** that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to \\"I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way.\\"----------------------------------*View*: All killing is bad*Reasoning*: There are many forms of killing that are generally considered acceptable. Soldiers kill other soldiers in wartime, people are allowed to kill in self-defense, and criminals are executed due to their crimes. All of these are perfectly legal forms of killing, and though some are controversial most would agree that at least one of the three is justified. I believe that abortion is another one of these types of killing. This is also why I don't care whether the fetus is a human or not - I view it as a legally and morally justified form of killing.While I am interested in having my view changed, I am also interested in simply having a discussion on the topic. Let's talk about abortion!_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

"t1_ddf47dk"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"The pro-choice viewpoint centers around the ability for a woman to make a choice (hence the name). They often say things like \\"No one thinks abortion is a good thing, but a woman's right to make choices about her body is more important\\". But I do think that abortion is a good thing (hence me calling it pro-abortion). I think that the fact that it will allow women to make their own choices is a happy side effect, but it is not the core reason that I support easy abortion access.As far as abortion being the default, that's exactly what I do believe should be true. Unfortunately, I don't see any way of doing this without forcing abortions or somehow making humans sterile, which is completely unethical. If there were a good way of doing it I would support that. And when I say default, I mean that social norm should be \\"I am pregnant so I will get an abortion, but I suppose I should consider the alternative of pregnancy\\" rather than \\"I am pregnant, but I suppose I should consider the abortion option\\". That's also why I think doctors should be required to inform patients about it."
"t1_ddgjsy9"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"And I fully support sex education and easy birth control access. But even if there were free condoms delivered to your door daily and sex ed was taught liberally throughout a person's education, accidents are still going to happen. Abortion is, at that point, the only good solution that we currently have."
"t1_ddf6hrv"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"If that's the case then we need better terminology. I'm sick of only having two choices on anything political, there are more than two positions on every matter.My view is that we should be encouraging abortions as much as possible. This is not what the pro-choice movement is about. Their movement is about giving women rights.Just because I support gun rights doesn't mean I'm republican. Just because I support abortion rights doesn't mean I'm pro choice."
"t1_ddfbz4k"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; It would be a little like arguing about institutionalized racism back when outright slavery was still legal; that it would be a very valid line of argument doesn't make it any less irrelevant until the greater question is settled.I see your point, but there's a huge difference here. Abortion is, as of today, legal in all 50 states in America. I sort of feel like we've worked that one out, at least in the same sort of sense that we've worked out slavery. Yes, there are still many people who do not support abortion, but there are also still people who think blacks should be enslaved.I guess what I'm asking is, when exactly should we talk about this?"
"t1_ddgkvp7"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I really do think it's a shame that abortion access is difficult for some women. Abortion clinics should be easily accessible. I guess then that I feel that the stuff I'm talking about kinda goes along with the current battle. It's like - OK, we've gotten it legalized. Now how do we distribute it to the people?; Huge numbers of Americans have essentially no access to legal abortion.And that needs to change. The silver lining I think though is that at the very least, a 1000 mile drive to an abortion clinic is still better than no options at all. But we need to do better."
"t1_ddgkl5b"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"My point is that I feel my views differ enough from the \\"standard pro choice\\" to have a different label. There's overlap for sure but there always will be. There's overlap between republicans and democrats but it's still good to have a distinction."
"t1_ddf6kta"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"If that's the case then we need better terminology. I'm sick of only having two choices on anything political, there are more than two positions on every matter.My view is that we should be encouraging abortions as much as possible.

"t1_ddgk5k2"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"Pro choice is a really stupid name though. I think that marijuana should be legalized so that people have the **choice** of whether to smoke it or not. That means I'm pro-marijuana, not pro choice. I think that people should be allowed to buy guns so that they have the **choice** of whether to own one or not. Does that make me pro-choice? No, I'm pro gun.I think that people should be allowed to ~~buy guns~~ have an abortion so that they have the **choice** of whether to ~~own one~~ have a child or not. Does that make me pro-choice? No, I'm pro ~~gun~~ abortion. Or at least \\"pro abortion\\" would be a better term for it."
"t1_ddghkny"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; I know that the majority of americans are clueless as to what happens in an abortion procedure.The majority of Americans know what they need to know about abortion procedures - it removes the fetus from the woman and the fetus is killed in the process. You don't really need the details beyond that.I get what you're saying, it's not exactly a pleasant procedure. But there's no such thing as a pleasant surgery. Watch a video of a heart transplant, or a kidney removal. I'm sure that those would be pretty gruesome too. So should we start making people who need a kidney removed watch a video of the surgery?You can definitely think of it as murder if that's what it seems like to you. The only way to change your mind on that would be to convince you that the fetus is not equal to a human life. I don't think I can do that because right now we just don't have the science to pinpoint exactly where a human life begins. Most people don't think that an egg transforms into a human the microsecond that sperm touches it. Maybe you do, but that's a pretty hard position to defend. And everyone agrees that a born baby is a human. So somewhere between those two things it must go from a bundle of cells to a human. But where exactly is that point? That's what's controversial.So the best I can say is that yes, maybe it is murder. But I don't care. It's murder that makes everyone's life better. It's murder that saves a child from growing up in a shit situation. It's murder that alleviates a potential burden from society, and especially from the mother and father. It's murder that could save that woman's life, and does she not deserve a fair shot at her life too? That's why I don't really care if you think it's murder. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But it certainly isn't the exact same thing as just walking up to someone on the street and blowing their head off with a shotgun. If you can't see the difference there, then there's not a whole lot of discussion left to be had. But there's a crystal clear difference there to me, and that's why I support abortion rights."
"t1_ddgwjml"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; so what youre saying is that you dont really care what happens to a baby, you like abortion?I'm not sure I'm understanding you correctly. If you mean fetus, then yes I don't really care what happens to it (as in I have no empathy for it).If you mean baby as in a born baby, then I do care what happens to it because at this point it is a self-surviving human that does not need to leech nutrients from another human to survive. It can be given away for adoption at this point."
"t1_ddglgxi"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I've sort of addressed points like this in other parts of this post, but a good short version is this.All of the reasons that I support an early term abortion still apply in the late term. The fetus is still a threat to the mother's life. The fetus is still unwanted, and still is more likely to grow up to become a criminal. Etc.The main difference here is that the fetus could survive outside of the womb. But that would require a c-section which is, by my understanding, more dangerous than abortion. So abortion is still the safest option, and therefore saving the fetus' life puts unneeded risk on the mother.And let's compare that to an old person who is no longer \\"useful\\" (though I disagree that old people aren't useful, let's just run with it for now). An old person may be a drain on society in a way, but at least there isn't much of a chance that they will grow up to be a criminal and therefore less of a drain and more of an active danger. More importantly though, old people aren't a direct risk to another person's life like the fetus is.; Surely if we are talking about allowing a woman to be rid of her parasite that far into her pregnancy, it should be to remove it the fetus still 'alive' rather than to kill it?I sort of mentioned it already but I would only agree with this if the removal procedure was safer for the woman than the abortion procedure, AND the woman wished for that to be the option, AND the woman had the option of giving up the child for adoption and never seeing it again."
"t1_ddgj03j"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; Why should the cutoff point be birth?Because adoption is an option after birth but not before. A c-section is another option but it is less safe than an abortion (as far as my understanding goes). We should not force women who don't want their babies to go through a more dangerous surgery just to save the fetus.I also think it simply works well as a very clear cutoff point. We have to draw the line somewhere. The only two places to draw it that aren't completely arbitrary are at the moment of conception or at birth. Drawing it at the moment of conception is harmful for all kinds of reasons, so I think that birth is the best one."
"t1_ddf6klk"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I don't mind at all. And yes, that's pretty much exactly what I'm proposing. That doctors should be required to inform all of their pregnant patients about the option of abortion."
"t1_ddf4cpk"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; At what point do we need to start killing people who have already been born?We don't.; Evolution essentially designed the female body for pregnancy and birth. Pregnancy is the human body functioning as designed. Being pregnant causes difficulty but it is not the same as having a parasite.It is the same in every way except that in one case the parasite could potentially become a non-parasite someday. But at the moment it is aborted, it has a lot in common with parasites, and I've listed the reasons why.; There are easier ways of preventing pregnancy that are less expensive and less harmful to women than abortion.Agreed. I fully support easy/free access to birth control, sexual education, etc. However, abortion still needs to be on the table because these methods are not foolproof and abortion serves as a good backup plan."
"t1_ddgjynp"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; The difference between a fetus and an actual parasite (such as a mosquito) is that you didn't choose for the parasite to be there. Aside from cases like rape, the woman performed actions which directly led to the fetus being inside of her.You can still get pregnant even if you use a condom or are on the pill. Yeah, she could have just never had sex. And if you didn't want to get bit by a mosquito you could just never go outside. Going outside though is an action which could directly lead to a mosquito bite. But if someone slaps a mosquito are you going to tell them \Don't slap it, that's a life! Instead you should have stayed indoors for your whole life.\\"

"t1_ddf5wm8"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I don't think that contraception/education are more beneficial, I think they are equally beneficial. To me it doesn't matter how you stop a childbirth. There's no moral difference between pulling out, wearing a condom, aborting the fetus, or taking the pill. The only advantage that contraception has is that it is generally cheaper. That's why I believe that all birth control whether it's condoms or abortion should be funded by the government, and paid for by taxpayers.I consider myself to be pro-abortion because abortion is the most \\"powerful\\" form of birth control (i.e. it's the one you go to when the others fail)."
"t1_ddf750i"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I still pretty much agree, but this is sort of getting off topic. Contraception only tangentially fits into this topic. Just because there are preferable alternatives to abortion doesn't mean someone is anti-abortion. Contraception is the much less controversial topic, so I'm focusing on abortion because I feel like most reasonable people basically already agree that contraception is ok and generally easier on the body/mind than abortion is."
"t1_ddfbywh"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; where you differ from standard pro-choiceHere are the places where I feel I differ from \\"standard pro-choice\\". Keep in mind that my definition may differ slightly from yours as to what \\"standard pro-choice\\" is, but I'll try to focus on what I most commonly see.1. Standard pro-choice is generally focused on the ability for the woman to make a choice for herself (hence the name). Sorta like \\"people should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies -&gt; women are people -&gt; women should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies\\". My view is more focused on the (almost universal) positive aspects of abortion. More like \\"aborting unwanted babies is always a good thing for society -&gt; we should be encouraging people to make choices that benefit society &gt; therefore we should be encouraging people to abort their unwanted babies\\". Women's rights don't really factor into my view, but are a happy side effect.2. Most pro-choice people are uncomfortable with the idea of late-term abortions. I have no problem with late-term abortions, and in fact I think they should be encouraged (if it comes to it, early term abortions are better, but late term is still better than childbirth).3. As far as I know, \\"standard pro-choice\\" does not support government funded abortions or mandatory doctor information about abortions. Essentially, I think that abortions should be incentived by the government as opposed to childbirth. Standard pro choice usually views abortions as a \\"necessary evil\\"; something that should NOT be encouraged but should still be an option.4. Terminology. I haven't mentioned this one yet because it's quite different from the others, but I simply think that the term \\"pro-choice\\" is stupid. You can be pro-gun without thinking that gun ownership should be mandatory. You can be pro-marijuana without thinking that everyone should be required to smoke weed. These are also things where you think that people should have the \\"choice\\" to either partake or not. So it could be argued that all of these positions should be called \\"pro-choice\\". I think that by calling my position \\"pro-abortion\\", it draws attention to the real issue."
"t1_ddf5o4l"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; So any amount of environmental damage is worth a single human life?That isn't what I said, what I said was that an unwanted child is detrimental to society, and the environmental impact is just one of the reasons why.; The relationship between a fetus and a pregnant women is more complicated than parasite and host.If this is the case, then please explain why.; Abortion is not a pleasant experience (especially if you are talking about abortion at 9 months), so it is weird to be \\"pro-Abortion\\".I could argue that childbirth is an unpleasant experience after 9 months, so it would be weird to be pro-childbirth (a.k.a. pro life). It doesn't have to be pleasant to be more pleasant than the alternative."
"t1_ddfbyus"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; The female body is designed to gestate a fetus.And my body is designed to survive a mosquito bite. Mosquitos are still parasites though.; The fetus gains nothing by weakening the mother it is not an evolutionary viable trait for us to develop. No parasite functions like this.I would still slap mosquitos even if they bit me just to be assholes and they didn't gain anything from it. The only difference between the parasite and the fetus that you've pointed out is completely irrelevant - I don't really care why they're stealing my nutrients."
"t1_ddgm081"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; Also, you cannot call it a parasite when there is specific apparatus to keep it alive and healthy, and create it. Ovaries, eggs, the entire repurductive system etc. Can we call poison poison even though there's a system (liver) designed to deal with it? It can still fail and you'll end up dead, just like reproduction. The fact that systems are in place to help deal with a parasite doesn't hold up as much when there's a relatively high risk of dying from pregnancy."
"t1_ddgwdhq"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"Ok, this is a good point. I agree with you and you've done a good job pointing out the differences between a fetus and a parasite. And I like your idea that it's better to consider it some sort of a tumor. From now on, I think that's a better analogy to use.That doesn't exactly change my core view because a tumor is hardly better than a parasite, but it's something that I hadn't considered before and it does modify my original position a bit. I suppose that deseves a delta. ∆"
"t1_ddgyhac"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"Ok but literally everything is a separate class if you look at it through a microscope. Two specks of dust could be in \\"different classes\\" because they're shaped slightly differently.I've picked out the parts of tumors/fetuses that I think are both relevant and similar. Namely that they feed off the host, they are dangerous, and if they are unwanted then they provide no benefit to the host. Yeah, there are a few differences like taking care of a tumor after it's gone but those aren't relevant because you don't have to take care of a child after it's gone either (adoption)."
"t1_ddgwv6d"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I actually didn't know what this was until I saw your comment and looked it up. From what I understand, it's a method of abortion that involves partially removing the fetus from the womb, then killing it.My thoughts on it are the same as for any other abortion - namely that if the woman wants an abortion and it is the safest option for her, then it's the option that she should be encouraged to choose."
"t1_ddgyatt"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; It's way past \\"fetus\\" at this point and now into personhood don't you think?No I don't.; I think at that point abortion isn't \\"safest for the mother.\\"Possibly. But if it isn't then we should encourage her to look into other options. The ultimate decisions should still be hers though."
"t1_ddf67t8"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; but increased taxes because people don't use condoms properly isn't going to fly with most people no matter how small the increaseI'm well aware of that.

"t1_ddgkhbw"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; we can't just kill people if we think it'd better societyNo, but that's just one of several reasons I listed. If they're a leech to society, AND they're threatening a person's life AND they are going to place an enormous financial burden on people AND no one really wants that particular person around anyway least of all the person who they would be around the most, THEN it starts to sound more reasonable."
"t1_ddgiql6"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; I am fairly sure that the core of pretty much every view you explain here is still 100% that you believe that a fetus (at all points from conception to live birth) is not valued as a human life by you and in fact better classified as a parasite, like a mosquito. I don't get how you are asking people to look past that, or to not get \\"hung up\\" on that fact. That ABSOLUTELY IS the conversation we are having when discussing abortion in general, and we cannot sneak past the difference in belief.I think you've misunderstood me here. I wasn't saying it isn't an important discussion point. I said not to get hung up on it because I wanted to avoid arguing about whether a fetus is a human or not. I don't care if it is. I don't care if it isn't. It would make no difference on my views. So since I don't care if it is a human life, I said \\"let's just assume that it IS a human life\\" to appease the pro-lifers who would get hung up on that. I wanted the discussion to be about \\"Assuming that a fetus is a human life, is abortion still an OK thing?\\" And my answer to that question is yes.; If you did think the fetus to be a human life (I am not sure how you can honestly sympathize with that), are you suggesting that killing a human life at 5 months living in the womb would be different than killing it at 5 months living in someone living room?That's exactly what I'm suggesting.; Would you kill a 6-month-old child if the husband leaves and supporting the child now doesn't make financial sense, like you might for a child in the womb for 7 months?No I would not because at that point adoption is an option. Adoption is not an option for a fetus. I actually awarded a delta to someone who played with the idea of some hypothetical surgical way of doing a sort of fetus adoption because it partially changed my view (regarding my terminology), but with current technology I still fully support all of the ideas I wrote.; I tend to think, that both morally and legally, if a fetus is considered a human life, and valued as a human life, then it would or should be protected as such, no?This was more what I mean when I mentioned soldiers and criminals. My point was not that a fetus is equivalent to these things. My only point was that there are already several situations where we expressly *don't* protect human life.; What are your thoughts when someone says that if population control and unwanted babies is the real issue here, what about not having sex to create more babies at all?I mean ideally that's a great idea. Good luck convincing the human race to stop having sex. People have been trying to do that for years and have gotten nowhere really. I don't think that that's a viable solution.Compare it to driving a car. If you want fewer people to die in car crashes, the solution is not to try to convince people to drive safer. The better solution is to engineer a safer car. Human error exists just like human instinct exists. You can't get rid of it. So solutions need to come from places that we DO have control of. For example, making safer cars, or allowing abortions."
"t1_ddgw4k6"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; We definitely disagree on that you can take the value of the human life out of the equation.I'm not taking the value of a human life out of the equation. I have factored it into the equation, given it plenty of thought, and I have still reached the conclusion that abortion is a net positive thing.; I think that I am understanding that you believe at the point of birth, coming out of the womb or cutting the umbilical cord or at some other point you hesitate to define, the value of the life becomes different.I'm not hesitant to define it. It's when the child is born. 10 seconds before birth it is not equivalent to a human, 10 seconds after birth it is. I have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, that is where I draw it.; Something has changed for you, I am just unclear as to what. The thing that has changed is that the baby switches from feeding off the mother directly to feeding off other sources. Those sources do not have to come from the biological mother after birth. Before birth, they do.; you will have to wait for the child to come out in order to give it awayAnd this carries a risk to the mother's life. She should not be forced to take that risk for something she doesn't want anyway. Especially when it helps the rest of society out too.; Are you saying that if giving a person away instantaneously to eliminate a problem or the potential for future problems is not an option, then it is morally OK to kill the person?Honestly I don't think it's morally OK for society to attach that person to you in the first place. You call it \\"giving a person away\\", but that wouldn't fly for any other person. I couldn't just show up to your home and start eating your food and say \\"I live here now\\". There are systems in place to remove me from your life if I tried to do that. Just like there are systems in place to remove the born child from your life (adoption).But if those systems went away, what would you do? If cops weren't a thing and I just barged into your house and simply wouldn't leave, then I think you'd be justified in killing me. So yeah, it might sound harsh but if adoption weren't a thing then yes, I think that there are situations where it would be morally OK for the mother to kill the baby. Animals do it all the time, and for good reasons. If the mother had to choose between her own life, or the life of her child, I wouldn't blame her for choosing herself. I hope this not only answers your question, but also explains why I don't see that as selfish.; It might be more relvant to say you are allowed to kill a person post-birth, only if to protect others or to punish them, but pre-birth other reasons can apply.That's actually exactly what I was getting at. My point was that we tend to agree that there are exceptional circumstances in which killing can be justified.; But IF a person truly does believe that having an abortion is killing a person, taking the life of your child (I really think you are not relating to that concept) then it's pretty friggin' crazy to think that one would kill that child in order to avoid having to raise them, if they could have just not had sex or used a condom to likely prevent the issue.And if a person really truly feels that way, then it should be on them to remain celibate. I'm not advocating for forced abortions. If a woman doesn't want a baby but becomes pregnant anyway, she should have the option. But if she thinks that's murdering a baby, she can opt to not have that abortion. No one's going to force her.; There are laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe driving to keep people from dying.And in my opinion there should be laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe sex and to keep people from having unwanted pregnancies. Sex education is a thing that I fully support and think should be expanded. Just like driver's education. But we both know that even if we had 10 years of those classes, accidents will still happen.; If what you are saying is true, then why are people getting punished all over the world for driving unsafely?People don't/shouldn't get punished for driving unsafely if it truly was an unavoidable accident. Just like people shouldn't be punished for having an accidental pregnancy.I actually think the analogy is pretty good."
"t1_ddgmc4p"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; The fetus didn't ask to be created or to be forced to live off of stolen nutrients for 9 months.I don't see how this really matters a whole lot. A mosquito didn't ask to be born either, thus forcing it into a parasitic relationship with the world. But I'm still gonna slap it if it bites me.; Sadly, the father doesn't have to deal with the issues the mother does.I think it's interesting that you've mentioned this. I didn't mention every reason that I support abortion rights in my OP because some of them are just emotional and don't fit well into a logical discussion, so I excluded them. One of those reasons is that women having abortion access helps me out as a man. If I were to ever accidentally get a girl pregnant, I would definitely want her to be able to get an abortion. Otherwise I'd get stuck in a shitty situation that I didn't want to be in.So I disagree than the father doesn't have to deal with the issues (although they are OBVIOUSLY not on the same scale or equivalent). I know this isn't really the main point of the discussion but you mentioned it so I thought I would comment."
"t1_ddgjp2l"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; I'm gonna go out on a limb and assume you've never been pregnant and/or never had children cause some of your points are straight up r/childfree material.That would be correct, I do not have children and I don't ever intend to. Also I'm a man so yep, no pregnancy. I'm not a participant on /r/childfree so I don't know specifics but I got the impression it was sort of just a support group for people who don't want kids. &gt; having doctors inform all pregnant women about the option of abortion is very offensiveIf this legislation were passed it would almost certainly become common knowledge. A pregnant woman walking into the doctor's office would know that the doctor is legally required to talk to her about abortion, so she should not be offended that they're just doing their job.; Everyone knows abortion is an option so there's no need to bring it up to someone who doesn't wanna hear itYes, but many people might not know the specifics. What are the risks? How long does it take? What are the costs? Having all the information for both pregnancy and abortion laid out side by side would help people make more informed decisions.; They have just as much potential to be future tax payers and productive members of society as a wanted child.They really don't though. They have potential, but not as much as a wanted child. Here is an excerpt from the wikipedia article on abortion and crime.(source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect); \\"Data indicates that crime in the United States started to decline in 1992. Donohue and Levitt suggest that the absence of unwanted children, following legalization in 1973, led to a reduction in crime 18 years later, starting in 1992 and dropping sharply in 1995. These would have been the peak crime-committing years of the unborn children.\\"Now obviously that isn't conclusive proof. But it makes a lot of sense, and there is at least some evidence suggesting that unwanted children are more likely to become criminals than wanted ones. So unless you can find some reason that that study is bogus, I'm going to have to disagree with you that they have \\"just as much potential to be future tax payers and productive members of society as a wanted child\\"."
"t1_ddfbz1a"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; the views that you have given thus far could all be given in support of letting unwanted babies die. Do you also hold this view?I don't, and here is the key difference. A baby that has been born is no longer directly dependent on its mothers nutrients for survival. They could get their nutrients from anywhere. Once the baby is born, giving it up for adoption is a valid option. To tie this in with my views specifically, imagine that tomorrow some technology was invented that allowed people to get fetuses out of themselves, put them in some sort of artificial womb, and let them continue their development there free from the mother. If/when this technology becomes available it will have a drastic effect on my views, but since it is not yet available I see abortion as the best option when you've got a fetus in you that you don't want.; You could say something like: all people have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. This gives them the right to refuse to care for others. Therefore, people have the right to refuse to care for fetuses (thus letting them die).Again, adoption is a thing. We actually DO have the right to refuse to care for a baby if we don't want it and it's already born.So what you're saying is even if the fetus could theoretically survive if the woman went through special surgical procedures, no woman should be forced to go through with this procedure. Instead, women should retain their right to an abortion, even if the baby could be saved (because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy).Yes.... almost. I would completely agree with it if you changed \\"because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy\\" to \\"because aborting unwanted fetuses is generally good for everyone\\".; Further, we actually should let all unwanted babies die, because it would be good for society.Honestly from a 100% pragmatic perspective that's probably true. But that's getting off on a tangent. Keep in mind that one of the biggest differences between a fetus and a born baby is that the born baby does not pose any threat to the mother any longer (as long as she's allowed to give it up for adoption). The same cannot be said for a fetus. If we compare abortion to this hypothetical surgery that would get the baby out, it would matter a lot how risky both options are. I don't know of any such procedure that would be less risky than an abortion. If there were such a procedure that would probably change my view, at least on late term abortions."
"t1_ddfnj5w"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"Ok, I'm going to stop quoting every part of your post because I think that it all sort of ties together, and because of that it has partially changed my view.I think that all three of your points work pretty well together. To begin with, I think that your point about the theoretical surgery that was just as safe as the abortion procedure is interesting. ; But let's run with this idea that abortions are acceptable unless their are other safe alternatives to remove the baby. That is, abortions are not acceptable when the fetus can be safely removed without dying (I think this is your view, yes?).I started thinking about it, consider a hypothetical situation where a woman does not wish to have a child. The doctor tells her that she can have the fetus removed by aborting it or by another procedure that would save its life. After the procedure, the woman would never have to see the child again because it would be taken away and given to adoptive parents before she even woke up.In this situation, I think that the most logical thing to do would be to encourage the woman to go with whichever option was safer for her, but ultimately leave the decision up to her. After all, she could also choose not to have either. I'd like to label this idea as **point 1** because it is relevant to my view being changed. The main idea is that in this situation the woman's preferences would be the only thing worth discussing (unlike a real-world scenario in which you could never have two equivalent choices - right now you've just got abortion and childbirth, both of which have very different long-term outcomes that would need to be discussed). Also, just so it's clear, by 'preferences', I mean that since the woman is having identical outcomes anyway, it's just a matter of whichever option sounds nicer to her. So in this hypothetical scenario, it is shown that the woman's personal preference should have some bearing on what we encourage her to do.But let's ignore the option of carrying the fetus to term for now because she is absolutely certain that she does not want to go through with the pregnancy. In this case, I started considering what I would feel to be the \\"right\\" choice. To me it is definitely whichever poses less risk, but then I considered the case of a tie. In this situation, it still seems to me that abortion is the right choice because of all the other benefits I have listed. To address the portion of your post I have quoted specifically, this is why I believe that abortion is still typically the better option.So this idea alone has not changed my view, but now I want to tie it in with your other points.Why can't you say the exact same thing with regard to killing unwanted babies? Why can't you say \\" aborting killing unwanted babies is always a good thing for society -&gt; we should be encouraging people to make choices that benefit society &gt; therefore we should be encouraging people to abort kill their unwanted babies\\". How is this argument not exactly the same? Note that I'm saying killing babies, not \\"merely\\" letting them die.Others have joked about it but you actually make a pretty good case for killing babies :) ......but seriously though, no I am not completely heartless. I don't think that intentionally murdering an infant is in any way acceptable, or could ever be justified (except in incredibly contrived circumstances that really have no bearing on the real world. Think trolley problem stuff).; Now, you might say that the difference between killing unwanted babies and aborting unwanted fetuses is this: a fetus necessarily hinders the bodily autonomy of its \\"host\\" in a way that babies do not (i.e. you can remove the baby from your life without killing it, unlike a fetus). But, as you say in the above quote, bodily autonomy has nothing to do with your support for abortion; bodily autonomy is, as you say, \\"a happy side effect\\". You are justifying aborting unwanted fetuses by appealing solely to the benefits to society. So, again, how does this not support killing unwanted babies?This is also a very good point. I would like to reiterate a small bit of my view first - the part regarding the reasons for me feeling that it differs from a typical pro-choice view. I referred to my view as \\"pro-abortion\\" because I felt that the woman's choice was more of a happy side effect than a main cause for my views on abortion.Now, with that in mind let's address your points. You're absolutely right that the difference between killing the baby and having the abortion is that the fetus is feeding off the mother. This though is why we should be informing all women about their options with abortion, so that they are aware of the potential risks that can come with the pregnancy. The reason I think we should do this is in the hopes that she chooses the abortion option because1. It benefits us2. If the baby is unwanted, it benefits the womanIt's a win-win situation. And the way it benefits her is that it removes what is essentially a parasite from her body (and life, keep in mind that babies are \\"financial parasites\\" in a way. Not really the same thing though). I think that doctors should encourage ALL patients to remove ALL parasites from their bodies because allowing a parasite to live off you at your expense is no way to live.So here's how I sum it all up. This point demonstrates why I feel that abortion should be encouraged. The reason is because her bodily autonomy is being hindered by the fetus, and just like any other parasite it's better to be rid of it. Now remember Point 1. This point demonstrated a case in which the woman's personal preferences would be the deciding factor in which of two options should be encouraged: abortion or a fetus-removal-surgery.To sum it all up, you've demonstrated that my way of justifying abortions without justifying baby-killing is that fetuses hinder bodily autonomy. You've also demonstrated that a woman's personal preferences about her bodily autonomy could have an effect on what doctors encourage her to do in a situation where both outcomes were equally balanced. Therefore, I suppose that I can't deny that a woman's \\"choice\\" does have a central effect on my views, and therefore my views are some form of \\"pro-choice\\". ∆However, I'll say that with the caveat that I now feel that there should still be some sort of distinction within the field of pro-choice that would accurately distinguish these sorts of views from \\"standard pro choice\\". Maybe rather than calling it pro-abortion, I should refer to it as \\"alt-pro-choice\\" or something. I'll definitely think about it some more.Also, this has been a really good/productive discussion and I'm curious, did I address all of your key points in a way that you agree with?Edit: Minor grammar changes"
"t1_ddlwk1r"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"Look through some of my other comments, several other people have brought up other birth control options. Essentially, I'm all for them being provided for free by the government as well. I fully support easy-access birth control and sex education."
"t1_ddlyhwa"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"The way I see it, there are four categories of men with pregnant girlfriends/wives (of course it could also be a stranger or something but let's keep it simple)1. Men who want the child and their gf/wife also does2. Men who do not want the child and neither does their gf/wife3. Men who want the child but their gf/wife does not4. Men who don't want the child but their gf/wife doesThe way I see it, if abortion is illegal, men get screwed in number 2 and number 4. If abortion is legal, group number 3 gets screwed and group number 4 *possibly* gets screwed but they will be able to talk to the person and it's possible that they might help them realize that a baby with an unwilling father is going to have a bad life anyway. At the very least, there's a chance.Men's rights is actually a reason why I support abortion so heavily. I really hate how it's painted as such a sexist thing. Like, it's common to hear people say \\"pro-life people want men to regulate womens' vaginas\\". Which is true, but abortion rights *also affect men*, so I feel like we are victims of that too. Like, my girlfriend and I are very like minded on this subject. If I accidentally got her pregnant tomorrow, I would absolutely want her to be able to get an abortion. It would fuck me over too if she were forced to have a baby"

"t1_ddgluyj"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; Hey OP, this is precisely pro-choice. What is it about the pro-choice argument you don't think applies to you? As someone else said, it's a more extreme form of pro-choice, but that doesn't make it not so. To me, half your arguments seem to start with \\"women should be able to...\\" Which to me is the literal definition of advocating choice! I've mentioned this elsewhere but I consider it somewhat different partially because it isn't really in line with the \\"typical\\" pro-choice viewpoint, and also because I just think that \\"pro-choice\\" is a stupid name. If you support someone's choice to smoke marijuana or not, you aren't pro-choice, you're pro-marijuana. Almost all controversial issues have a choice involved somehow (we usually aren't trying to force people to do things they don't want to do). Calling it pro-choice distracts from the real issue in my opinion. ; Side question: do you believe killing a pregnant woman who is a few days from giving birth is a double homicide? Or is it a complete non-human until birth? No, I would consider that a single homicide. I know the law currently doesn't but I disagree with the law on this one.; Many pro-choice people would in fact agree with many of your \\"pro-abortion\\" arguments you've made, I know I do.I know that they do; I briefly mentioned that my position is much closer to pro-choice than pro-life. But we tend to make political labels based on differences, not similarities. For example, Republicans and Democrats both believe that 9/11 was a bad thing, but we have different labels because they disagree on a bunch of other stuff. Just because my views have overlap with pro-choice views doesn't mean that they are exactly the same, or that we should use the exact same labels."
