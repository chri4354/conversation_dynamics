"t3_7j5asr"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"A zygote/fetus is a human being --&gt; It is immoral to kill human beings --&gt; Thus an abortion is immoral1) There is plenty of reason to suggest that a zygote/fetus is not a person, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't a human being2) Even among pro-choice advocates, most probably would agree that it is immoral to kill human beingsIn order to conclude that an abortion is a morally neutral act, one most disagree with points 1 and/or 2, and I can't see any reasonable way to do that.- We refer to the zygote/fetus as \\"the child\\", \\"the baby\\", etc... Not \\"it\\" or \\"the zygote\\" or \\"the thing\\".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

"t1_dr47ai8"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; First, as posed, it sounds as if you are saying abortion is always immoral. Saying it is sometimes immoral is not something, I think, that many if any people would disagree with.I wouldn't say like 100% literally always; probably should be an almost in there. But if society at large thinks it's sometimes immoral, then why is the debate never framed in a \\"when is it acceptable to abort...\\" way? It's always binary, which suggests the two sides aren't willing to budge at all.My view would be completely different if the thinking was something like *before 5 months legal, after 5 months illegal* and the two sides were debating about increasing/decreasing this limit.One important thing is that my view isn't really about what is/should be moral, but rather what society views as moral/immoral. Our society appears to place special moral value on zygotes and fetuses.If 87% of society thinks X is immoral, but I don't personally agree, that doesn't mean X isn't immoral. Morality is determined by our culture."
"t1_dr53g5y"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"why does a pregnant woman \\"losing the baby\\" bring extra sadness then? It shouldn't have any more impact on us than if she were to lose a set of keys. It's not like she can't just make another one (we don't see it that way)."
"t1_dr77mjk"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"∆I hadn't looked at it from that perspective at all. That way you phrase it seems perfectly reasonable to me."
"t1_dr46zxu"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"An important difference between a zygote and sperm is that, short of extreme circumstances, we know the zygote will develop into a person.I agree that I have the right to do so, but that doesn't mean the act wouldn't always be morally neutral.; Few people hold this belief, and instead most believe that other events indicate the beginning of moral value like a heart-beat or brain activity; or they think that moral value increases gradually over time.If that's true, then the framing of the abortion debate doesn't suppor that. Why wouldn't the debate be along the lines of \\"when is it longer okay to abort?\\" rather than the binary way it has always mostly been discussed."
"t1_dr46tvw"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"What do you think should hold a greater penalty and outrage? Tying someone down and exfoliating them against their will, or tying someone down and aborting their fetus against their will?"
"t1_dr53y15"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"So based on another quote I heard in this thread:1) A woman is forcibly kidnapped and exfoliated against her will2) A woman is forcibly kidnapped and her baby is aborted against her will.Obviously society would be more upset about scenario 2. Why? Is it really **only** because scenario 2 is more invasive? I think most in society would be especially impacted because the baby was lost. If we truly placed no special value on the zygote, then \\"losing\\" it would be equivalent to \\"losing\\" your wallet."
"t1_dr53kbi"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; Even if you consider a zygote a human being that human being has no more rights to the use of a persons body than you or me do. Abortion can still be moral/immoral despite what rights may or may not exist. My dog doesn't have the right to occupy my home, but if I just kick him out in the middle of winter because I feel like it, that's an immoral act."
"t1_dr3q0oy"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"It's legally acceptable to \\"murder\\" non-persons in other scenarios as well (EG - human in vegetative state)."
"t1_dr3q584"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; Is it immoral to kill someone who is attacking you and seems intent on killing you?When it isn't necessary and you intentionally killed them when you didn't need to? Yes.; Is it immoral to execute a convicted mass murderer?Yes; Is it immoral to kill the enemy in war?YesI'm not sure how this disputes the point though, it seems to confirm it actually."
"t1_dr3qrs2"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; Do you think a child is better off having known nothing but the peace of the womb, or being mistreated and abused by parents who didn’t want them for years until they are beaten to death or driven to suicide? The problem with scenarios like this (most common being the \\"cases of rape\\" hypothetical) is that it's kind of a dodge by the person making it usually.IE - If I were to tell you 'okay, abortion will be illegal unless the mother was raped or the parents plan to beat the child to death', sound okay? Of course that wouldn't sound okay; most on either side see abortion as binary and aren't willing to start negotiating terms."
"t1_dr3rga9"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"I already agree with the legality of abortion though"
"t1_dr3r0mk"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"There is still moral value to the zygote though is there not? What if one house was empty, but the other contained a zygote? Wouldn't most prioritize the house with the zygote in it?We'd have to (as a society) come to the point where the presence of the zygote would be irrelevant to the hypothetical to conclude that zygote's have no moral value right? IE - Your hypothetical would make as much sense as the same but it's one house filled with andesite rocks, and another filled with gabbro rocks."
"t1_dr3ssa8"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"Sure, there are different levels of moral value associated to people. If multiple people are in a burning building, and only one can be saved, most in society would agree (even if they don't know it) that the preferred order is a child, a female, then lastly a male. It would be considered strange if the male was saved over a child or a female.But that doesn't mean it's okay to murder males."
"t1_dr3r6ar"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; however the rights of the alive, conscious woman override the 'rights' of the arguably not living fetusAgreed, but this speaks to legality not morality (I'm already in agreement with legality)"
"t1_dr46dqu"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"I think in this context the semantics are important. For instance, stating that sometimes the immoral choice is the right one wouldn't make sense without a clear distinction between immoral/moral and right/wrong.It's important in this case since my view towards the morality of abortion isn't to mean that abortion should be illegal."
"t1_dr3re2o"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; it is a moral or social construct that we put around a personRight, but doesn't the way our society refers to zygotes (examples in post) imply that we consider them human beings? If there weren't any examples of our society giving special value to zygotes, then sure I'd agree.; it is moral for me to kick him out even if he might die of exposure on the streetsThis reminds me of the church guy in Texas who everybody hated because he closed the doors of his church during the Hurricane. Society seemed to consider that an immoral act."
"t1_dr5x8og"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"So is there counter evidence that suggests our culture doesn't place special value on a zygote? Like something common in our society that points to us not giving it special value?"
"t1_dr3rklm"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"1) I think the consent in this case was having sex2) Stating that abortion is immoral doesn't also imply that we should never do things that are immoral"
"t1_dr3swot"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"Well \\"right/wrong\\" is different than \\"moral/immoral\\" too. Right/Wrong is more like *what if everyone in society did this? Would it still be okay?*"
"t1_dr3th9h"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"Yeah, so it is right to ensure everyone has the choice to abort. But that doesn't mean that all abortions are morally neutral."
"t1_dr46o1k"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"Not 100% no. But I can 100% conclude that all evidence of mainstream society suggests we place moral value on zygotes and fetuses."
"t1_dr3snnm"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"A person must be capable of conscious thought; A sentient being. Human is scientific. It means part of the species of homo-sapiens, nothing more. EG - A human in a vegetative state on life support is not a person, but is still a human."
"t1_dr469a5"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; I stipulate that you define \\"human being\\" to mean \\"anything with human DNA\\" basicallyWell no; Like I wouldn't refer to a strand of hair as a human being.; This just transparently has no moral significanceI think it does, since it is evidence of our society placing moral significance upon the fetus.To your other points, I'm used to the abortion discussions being framed in a binary sense. Going into \\"negotiations\\" (EG - Abortions before 5 months legal, after 5 months illegal) just aren't common."
"t1_dr46gvm"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"So I see your points, and they make sense. But do you think your views are really common amongst mainstream society (IE - Do the majority feel the same way)? My experience is that your views are very unique."
"t1_dr46kym"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"I don't think pointing out that the act is immoral is guilting people out of an abortion.Abortions being immoral doesn't mean that the state putting people in prison for getting abortions is a moral act either."
