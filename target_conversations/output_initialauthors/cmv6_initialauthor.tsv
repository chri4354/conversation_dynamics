That's just your opinion. That most certainly is not the way society operates legally, and not morally either for at least half of all Americans (without looking it up).	0.9291966557502747	0.9412863254547119	0.0420551672577858

5	t1_dghga3r	[deleted]		It's simple really: Neither abortion nor banning or discouraging abortion is a victimless action. Abortion favors the rights of the woman at the expense of the fetus. Banning or discouraging abortion favors the rights of the fetus at the expense of the woman. ; Rather, we should [...] teach respect for the human life that resides in a woman's body. Doing so would be inherently at the expense of teaching respect for women's bodily autonomy.	0.4494612514972687	0.47247180342674255	0.47326457500457764

11	t1_dghl2l4	[deleted]		"&gt; Referring to women who, knowing fully the risks of pregnancy when they engaged in sexAh ha, no abortion discussion has ever gone on without this being brought up. Elsewhere you gave a delta for pointing out that the conditions under which a fetus are created doesn't affect whether or not it is moral to kill a fetus, so this argument that you bring up is moot. Consenting to sex is not consenting to carrying a pregnancy to term and giving birth. Abortion exists as a medical procedure that has been invented, therefor when a woman engages in sex, she does so knowing that IF she becomes pregnant even though she isn't trying to, she has the option to abort it. Just like when she has sex, she does so knowing that if she gets an STD, there are medical options to take care of it. If someone wants to discourage or restrict a woman from all the options that exist for her in this situation, that person or government body needs a valid reason to do so. \\You knew this was a possibility when you had sex!\\"" isn't a valid reason to restrict women from a medical procedure."""	0.9989872574806213	0.8315312266349792	0.3706571161746979

13	t1_dghi9uj	[deleted]		&gt; Take severely mentally challenged peopleThat's a different situation. Those people do not exist as beings physically attached to one specific person's blood stream and nutrients system through an umbilical cord, usurping that person's bodily nutrients and energy for its own. A fetus does. So a fetus lacks consciousness, not knowing it exists and won't be able to know when it no longer exists, *and* is it usurping one specific woman's bodily resources and energy when she wants to stop that.	0.9996440410614014	0.9996440410614014	8.052587509155273e-05
