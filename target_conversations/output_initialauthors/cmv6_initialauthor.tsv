That's just your opinion. That most certainly is not the way society operates legally, and not morally either for at least half of all Americans (without looking it up)."

"t1_dghga3r"	"[deleted]"	NA	"It's simple really: Neither abortion nor banning or discouraging abortion is a victimless action. Abortion favors the rights of the woman at the expense of the fetus. Banning or discouraging abortion favors the rights of the fetus at the expense of the woman. ; Rather, we should [...] teach respect for the human life that resides in a woman's body. Doing so would be inherently at the expense of teaching respect for women's bodily autonomy."
"t1_dghiist"	"[deleted]"	NA	"Well, no, that spiraling train of thought isn't right because we as a society have laid out what a person's rights are. (Incidentally we have not extends those rights to fetuses, so *that* is actually where I was taking liberty with the word \\"rights,\\" but let's ignore that.) We as a society have laid out what a person's rights are. One of those rights is the right to make your own medical decisions, another is the right to self defense, another is the right not to have other people do things to your body against your will, another is the right to privacy regarding your health and medical decisions."

Because not to downplay the systematic enslavement of black people in America that most Americans are referring to when they say \\"slavery,\\" but I would argue that forcing women to carry pregnancies to term against their will and go through labor and give birth against their will is a form of slavery."

"t1_dghl2l4"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; Referring to women who, knowing fully the risks of pregnancy when they engaged in sexAh ha, no abortion discussion has ever gone on without this being brought up. Elsewhere you gave a delta for pointing out that the conditions under which a fetus are created doesn't affect whether or not it is moral to kill a fetus, so this argument that you bring up is moot. Consenting to sex is not consenting to carrying a pregnancy to term and giving birth. Abortion exists as a medical procedure that has been invented, therefor when a woman engages in sex, she does so knowing that IF she becomes pregnant even though she isn't trying to, she has the option to abort it. Just like when she has sex, she does so knowing that if she gets an STD, there are medical options to take care of it. If someone wants to discourage or restrict a woman from all the options that exist for her in this situation, that person or government body needs a valid reason to do so. \\"You knew this was a possibility when you had sex!\\" isn't a valid reason to restrict women from a medical procedure."

"t1_dghi9uj"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; Take severely mentally challenged peopleThat's a different situation. Those people do not exist as beings physically attached to one specific person's blood stream and nutrients system through an umbilical cord, usurping that person's bodily nutrients and energy for its own. A fetus does. So a fetus lacks consciousness, not knowing it exists and won't be able to know when it no longer exists, *and* is it usurping one specific woman's bodily resources and energy when she wants to stop that."
"t1_dghieag"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; to see the new life gets what it needs to become a healthy functioning member of societyIt seems you're not drawing an arbitrary line as to when that *ends.* We as a society don't do everything possible to see that all newborn infants become healthy functioning member of society. Not newborn infants, not toddlers, children, teens, adults... only fetuses? At the direct expense of women? Taking away women's ability to be healthy functioning adults to temporarily enslave them to any fetuses they happen to get pregnant with?"
"t1_dghkvgk"	"[deleted]"	NA	"We don't even have universal *health* care.Additionally, you're talking about taking away women's ability to be healthy functioning adults to temporarily enslave them to any fetuses they happen to get pregnant with."
