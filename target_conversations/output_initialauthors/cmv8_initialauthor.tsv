"t3_6ihcuk"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"I'm pro-choice, but I also think that the traditional talking points on both sides completely ignore those on the other side. The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\"Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\"But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

"t1_dj6ctbq"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"To be clear, I didn't mean the word \\"reconcile\\" to mean \\"solve\\"; I meant it in the sense of resolving a paradox or cognitive dissonance. I just meant it's the only logically consistent view from which to consider both sides of the matter. A huge amount of time and effort is wasted by the pro-choice side of the debate by nitpicking whether it ends a human life or not. I don't know from where you get the condescending notion that I just took my first philosophy course or whatever it us you're implying."
"t1_dj7e97l"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"If you \\"set them free\\" 2 weeks after birth, a newborn baby also dies."
"t1_dj6cbbx"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"&gt; the anti-abortion campaigners believe that the developing human must be protected from being killed.This is obviously the hypocritical view, unless they support the protection of all other inconvenient and/or non-self-protecting lives."
"t1_dj69xtt"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"I'm not really concerned with what makes my viewpoint more popular. I'm simply saying that the line between \\"a cluster of cells\\" and \\"a person\\" is arbitrary and ill-defined. I'm still just a cluster of cells, but I'm a cluster of cells with a bank account who's registered to vote."
"t1_dj6bqxp"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"I don't think you and I disagree at all. My point was that caring about life (to the exclusion of all other concerns) is untenable."
"t1_dj6d716"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"&gt; The other thing to point out is that the vast majority of pregnancy terminations are natural. Think about all the pregnancies that end naturally. Are lives lost in the first few months if a pregnancy comes to a natural end?As I pointed out elsewhere, the vast majority of deaths in the first few decades of life happen under age 5, so this isn't really as hard a distinction as you'd think."
"t1_dj6ex3u"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"If I say, \\"A fetus is a person. Birth is irrelevant.\\"And then you say, \\"Lots of fetuses die before birth,\\" to mean that they are less worthy of protection.How is that different from:I say \\"A baby is a person. Reaching age six is irrelevant.\\"And then someone says, \\"Lots of babies die before age five\\" to mean that they are less worthy of protection."
"t1_dj6foqx"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"I'm not arguing with your conclusion; I'm saying the argument doesn't make logical sense.You're saying that the high rate of mortality (or self-termination or whatever) of fetuses means that they shouldn't count as people, but the high rate of mortality of newborn babies doesn't mean the same thing.The only way that makes sense is if you're saying that there's a fundamental difference between a fetus and a baby, which you can certainly claim, but then you're using the conclusion of your argument as the premise of your argument.You're not wrong, you're just debating badly."
"t1_dj6gd5i"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"But I'm saying, if the point that we're arguing is when a fetus becomes \\"a person\\", how is it fair to say that ***prenatal*** survivability is relevant, but not postnatal? I'm saying what makes one matter but not the other, and your only answer is that they're OBVIOUSLY different.You're asserting a premise that, by itself, goes against the other side of the argument."
"t1_dj6guh2"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"&gt;Because we're talking about the part where humans go from 0 to 100, not the part afterwards when we're all already at 100.Right, and if MY view (the whole premise of my argument) is that at conception, the moment a sperm hits an egg, it goes from 0, straight to 100, then the likelihood of its survival after that moment would be just as irrelevant to me, right?"
"t1_dj6dmib"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"I'm Devil's advocating here, but if there was ever a sub for it...The right to the sanctity of your own body is definitely legally and philosophically recognized, but so is the sanctity of your home. Can't kick a kid out of there before they're ready without making arrangements for someone else to take them either."
"t1_dj6blks"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"&gt;I think there's a non-trivial point that you can define this...;somewhere between 22-25 weeks into the pregnancy.That's a good line, but not really an actionable one. You're still left with a 3-week gray area. I guess my point was that we don't *need* a clean line between \\"person\\" and \\"non-person\\". We can just accept that we, as a society, sometimes let people end a human life if it's a life that, for lack of a more diplomatic phrase, no one else has any investment in."
"t1_dj6a3wd"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"&gt; bodily integrity should be decisiveIsn't it troubling to make an ethical distinction that hinges on technological advancement? What makes a 24-week fetus conceived in 2017 more deserving of human rights than one conceived in 1950?For that matter, if the technology were ever developed to support a fetus from 2 weeks after conception, should the law change?"
"t1_dj6d16z"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"Sure. I was using conception because it's the one brought up most often. You could definitely make an equally valid claim for birth as the dividing line. ∆!But I think you'd have even less fun convincing people that it's not killing if you abort a fetus right up until the moment you cut the umbilical cord than I have convincing people that the solution is to just make peace with the idea of killing people."
"t1_dj6eazy"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"In a world of 7 billion people, I'm less convinced of the lack of need for extremely niche laws like that, but your point it well taken. Δ I actually had to look up whether there *are* laws on the books regarding self-amputation, and while I wasn't able to find any, it's worth noting that, in your attempt to give an example of something so ridiculous that no one would ever do it, you actually kind of failed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_integrity_identity_disorderIt's a big, weird world. Don't underestimate what people will do if you let them."
"t1_dj7e53o"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"Sure, but since I was reaching for a large number, would my point really have been weakened by saying 1 billion?"
"t1_dj6cj5u"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"\\"If you provide for its basic needs, it will eventually be able to tell you it would like to not be killed.\\"It's a clumsy definition, but I feel like we can agree that this definition applies to a 6-month old child, but not a sperm cell. I can't formulate a similarly succinct rule that would define another clear dividing line other than conception."
"t1_dj6c8gs"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"Capability of living independently seems like a straight-up gruesome yardstick by which to measure whether a fetus/cell-cluster/adult-person-with-a-developmental-delay-disorder deserves legal protections."
"t1_dj6bymv"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"Life is tough when you're small. 13% of children born in Mexico die before they reach 5 years old, but they were still alive.I feel like people are focusing on the wrong half of the argument. My point was that we don't actually need to define a point at which human life begins."
"t1_dj947ts"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"The first part only provides fuel for the pro-life argument if you ignore the second part."
"t1_dj6ak4d"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"&gt; We weigh risk versus reward.;; So let's throw out speed limits and abortion and look at the concept of fighting.This is certainly a valid parallel, but the comparison I made to helmets for children riding in cars remains worth addressing.The reward would be small but undeniable. The \\"risk\\" would be only inconvenience for the parent.The underlying point I was making was not about variable risk so much as demonstrating that we don't necessarily prioritize protecting a life over vaguely defined personal liberty and the right to make choices for yourself."
