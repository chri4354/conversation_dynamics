0	t3_64szba	curiouscat145		I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.9912165999412537	0.7279090285301208	0.3905256390571594
1	t1_dg4tcmf	curiouscat145		∆ Really good point actually!There is not a discrete difference between a fetus and an infant. However there is a difference between a fetus and an infant though it is gradual. There have been several studies suggesting that up to a point fetuses do not feel pain and also do not have a central nervous system or conciousness. Therefore I would not consider them to be the same as newborn babies. But thank you for your view point!	0.9528027772903442	0.8407052159309387	0.17657114565372467

3	t1_dg4sivw	curiouscat145		I don't think of abortion as being as in the grey area of morality as that. I do think something immoral can be the morally best choice but I don't think that because it is 'squicky' that it is immoral.	0.979806661605835	0.979806661605835	0.005418837070465088
