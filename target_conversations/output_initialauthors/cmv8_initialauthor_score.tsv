0	t3_6ihcuk	Daniel_A_Johnson		"I'm pro-choice, but I also think that the traditional talking points on both sides completely ignore those on the other side. The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\a person\\"" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\""Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\""But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.
