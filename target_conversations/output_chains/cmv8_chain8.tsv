The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\"Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\"But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

"t1_dj68xot"	"alnicoblue"	"6"	";The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless.It's not at all pointless.There's more to this issue than human life-if it's not a human life than it's part of a woman's body.So if it's a life it's a murder issue, if it's not then it's a women's rights issue.I think that this is why abortion is one of if not the most difficult political issues. To a person who feels that life begins at conception a pro-choicer is a endorsing murder. To a person who disagrees the pro-lifer is violating a woman's right to her own body.;That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.We weigh risk versus reward.So let's throw out speed limits and abortion and look at the concept of fighting.We allow sports like MMA and boxing because the risk of injury, while high, can be offset by regulations and standards.We don't allow pistol duels, however, because the risk shoots up beyond a point where regulations can properly control.So higher speed limits assume risk but we offset that with safety technology, vehicle inspection, DWI laws and police presence.We can't control for risk in an abortion. The risk is very nearly 100%-the goal is to end the pregnancy.Now I'm pro choice so obviously I don't take the pro life view. But I don't believe that the comparison you're making really helps the debate-very few people would endorse activity that guarantees the death of a child."
"t1_dj6u1hc"	"waldrop02"	"2"	"&gt;There's more to this issue than human life-if it's not a human life than it's part of a woman's body.That's not true at all. It *uses* the woman's body, but that doesn't make it part of it, even if it isn't a human person. The entire point of the decision in Roe v. Wade was that a woman can control who uses her body and that laws infringing on that right must be fairly narrowly tailored. Other cases have modified the specifics slightly over the years, but the Roe framework is still mostly there."
"t1_dj6uhtf"	"alnicoblue"	"6"	"That's an interesting take on the subject and I'll definitely give it thought but I'm not sure that it signifies too much difference between our claims-at the end of the day it still becomes a women's rights issue."
"t1_dj6ujov"	"waldrop02"	"2"	"I should have clarified - I'm staunchly pro-choice, but I do view the fetus as a human person with a right to life. That right to life is merely a lacking argument for why it should be allowed to infringe on the woman's right to bodily autonomy."
"t1_dj7nlw0"	"Illiux"	NA	"Out of curiosity, if we develop artificial wombs technology to the point where the point of viability is nearly identical to the point of conception, would you therefore support making abortion illegal in favor of growing the fetus in an artificial womb? If not, on what basis?"
"t1_dj7ntig"	"waldrop02"	"2"	"I would. That day is unlikely to come any time soon, though."
