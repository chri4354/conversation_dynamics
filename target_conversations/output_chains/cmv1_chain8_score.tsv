Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dr45x34	Polychrist	6.0	I think there are a few things which are important to discuss here,First, as posed, it sounds as if you are saying abortion is *always* immoral. Saying it is *sometimes* immoral is not something, I think, that many if any people would disagree with. So all that needs to be offered to discredit your position is one singular example of an abortion being morally justified.Second, there are many, many ethical theories out there, and whether a given act is moral or not depends on the system you are utilizing. For example, an egoist would say that you are morally required do what’s in your own interest, so if it’s in your interest to get an abortion, you morally *ought to.* Utilitarians, in turn care only about the consequences of your actions, not the nature of the actions themselves. So, a utilitarian would say that it’s morally required to have an abortion if global utility is maximized by doing so (for example, if the world were overpopulating and it would likely starve anyway).However; assuming you do not adhere to either of those philosophies, or any specific philosophy, but are instead looking for a general “golden rule” perspective, i think a good question to start with is: is it ever morally acceptable to kill any animal? If so, why? If not, why not?You claim that it is wrong to kill a human being, but also note that a biological human is something different from a human being. What, then, is the status of a biological human zygote compared to a fully grown adult cow? Is it always immoral to kill a cow for food, and if so, are we not supposed to eat meat? I will assume this is not your position. If it is okay to kill a cow for our own benefit, why can we not kill a human-in-name-only clump of cells for our benefit? Surely, we shouldn’t say that *just because* many people refer to this clump of cells as a “baby,” we should give it special status. So instead we must differentiate, perhaps by saying that unlike cows, biological humans have *an inalienable right to life.* Finally, we are getting to the points that others have made. When does this right begin, and how strong of a right is it? You seem to agree that there is no *right* to someone else’s body or property, which is why you wouldn’t outlaw abortion. So why then is it any more morally acceptable to kill a cow than to abort a zygote, given that the cow, arguably, is at least not *reliant* upon another being for survival. If you want to see the perfectly moral person as someone who would never kill an animal or eat meat, someone who would open his home to as many of the homeless as he could fit, give endlessly, own nothing,And spend their whole life as a slave to the needs of others, then you should read Singer’s philosophy. He proposes much the same. But if you’re looking for more of an everyday philosophy based more on “do no unnecessary harm” and “treat your neighbor justly,” I don’t think abortion can be written off as immoral. At the beginning of this post i mentioned that you really only need one case of a moral abortion to counteract your position, so I’ll conclude with a few examples:Ex. 1) The zygote/fetus has a known serious birth defect, which will give them a very short painful life if carried to term.Ex. 2) the fetus is unlikely to survive childbirth, and it will endanger the mother if carried to term.Ex. 3) the mother is extremely young, and carrying the child to term would be traumatizing and dangerous.TL;DR: there are many different ethical philosophies, and which one you adhere to affects whether any action (including abortion) is acceptable or not. Based on the framing, you only need one example of a case where abortion is a moral thing to do; the case of a fetus with a detrimental defect is one such case.	0.2019326239824295	0.44509246945381165	0.44295552372932434
2	t1_dr47ai8	ZeusThunder369	7.0	"&gt; First, as posed, it sounds as if you are saying abortion is always immoral. Saying it is sometimes immoral is not something, I think, that many if any people would disagree with.I wouldn't say like 100% literally always; probably should be an almost in there. But if society at large thinks it's sometimes immoral, then why is the debate never framed in a \\when is it acceptable to abort...\\"" way? It's always binary, which suggests the two sides aren't willing to budge at all.My view would be completely different if the thinking was something like *before 5 months legal, after 5 months illegal* and the two sides were debating about increasing/decreasing this limit.One important thing is that my view isn't really about what is/should be moral, but rather what society views as moral/immoral. Our society appears to place special moral value on zygotes and fetuses.If 87% of society thinks X is immoral, but I don't personally agree, that doesn't mean X isn't immoral. Morality is determined by our culture."""	0.4653848111629486	0.4569185972213745	0.3742165267467499
3	t1_dr493qi	Polychrist	6.0	I think you must have misheard the debate, then. Many pro choice proponents support measures such as “not moral after the second trimester,” or similar. Likewise, many (not all) in the pro life camp admit that it is permissible in cases of rape and incest. Also, you can’t use societal statistics of what is accepted as moral as a standard and get consistent results (that’s probably where you’re having trouble). And I *certainly* don’t think there’s a consensus that it is immoral to abort a zygote one month into pregnancy. Really, if you want to rely on statistics, this article {https://www.vox.com/a/abortion-decision-statistics-opinions} conducted a survey and found that a mere 26% of respondents were staunchly pro life. In other words, I think you are misinformed... There doesn’t seem to be overwhelming support that a fetus has “special” moral value.	0.08156251907348633	0.3562473952770233	0.41895923018455505
4	t1_dr4mec2	yr8ebainbery		If it doesn’t have any special moral value, then, in your eyes, should abortions be an acceptable form of birth control?	0.9983119964599609	0.9983119964599609	0.0
5	t1_dr4pu38	cardboard-kansio		&gt; “not moral after the second trimester,” or similar; should abortions be an acceptable form of birth control?Not original commenter, but yes, under these conditions I would say that they are an acceptable form of birth control at a particular point.As mentioned above, women can become pregnant for many reasons: rape or incest, poor life choices, lack of education, or unexpected hardships such as the death or departure of a spouse shortly after impregnation. In these cases, women may not be in reasonable physical, mental, emotional, or financial circumstances to carry a baby to term, let alone to care for it.In situations like these, it's a huge personal risk as well as a societal burden to *force* the child to be born and then have it raised by the state or in foster care.	0.9137324094772339	0.8976019620895386	0.09386641532182693
6	t1_dr6bxv0	yr8ebainbery		I get that sometimess a woman needs to have an abortion.Maybe 1-3 times in their lifetime. But if a woman is using it regularly as a form of birth control, wouldn’t that raise concerns?	0.9758105278015137	0.6576204895973206	0.4623563587665558
7	t1_dr6cts4	cardboard-kansio		"Nobody said \\regularly\\"" - the argument was just as a *form* of birth control. I'd be concerned about *any* medical procedure being carried out regularly without good reason and proper preventative actions beforehand (in this case, other prophylaxis). But in the context of the original debate, no, I still have no problem with abortion when it's required."""	0.9996073842048645	0.6729304194450378	0.4621039628982544
