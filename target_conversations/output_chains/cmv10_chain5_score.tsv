0	buzzardsgutsman	"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."""		
1	Herdnerfer	45	Parents can't neglect their children, but they can rescind their parental rights and give their child to the state. Pregnant women have no such recourse.	0.4876493513584137
2	buzzardsgutsman	4	Pregnant women can also rescind their parental rights once the child is born in a matter of months. Yes that means they will have to go through the pregnancy, but equally a parent would have to continue to take care of their child until the state takes it off them, which is certainly not instant. Ultimately, I think if you're using a completely black &amp; white ideological argument to support bodily autonomy in pregnancy (saying a woman should be able to rescind her obligation absolutely anytime), you have to use the same standard for parenting as a whole, in which case child neglect should be legal. If you're starting to throw pragmatic elements into it, then its only fair you do the same for pregnancy/abortion, in which case I can only conclude that abortion shouldn't be allowed.	0.9809249639511108
3	z3r0shade	19	&gt; that means they will have to go through the pregnancy, but equally a parent would have to continue to take care of their child until the state takes it off them, which is certainly not instant.It is perfectly legal for a parent to drop their child off at a hospital anonymously right after it is born, it certainly can be instant if desired. If the technology existed such that we could remove the fetus without killing it, then I'd agree with a law that required using that and giving it up instead of killing the fetus. But since we do not have that technology, the fetus still doesn't have any right to use the women's body without her consent.; If you're starting to throw pragmatic elements into it, then its only fair you do the same for pregnancy/abortion, in which case I can only conclude that abortion shouldn't be allowed.How does saying a woman rescind her obligation at any time translate to child neglect being legal? In the case of a child, in order to rescind her obligations she must ensure the child is taken care of by *someone* ie: giving it up for adoption, dropping it at a safe haven, etc. In the case of a fetus, the woman's right to her own body trumps any rights you may assign to the fetus which most would argue does not have the same rights as a child.	0.5213685631752014
4	buzzardsgutsman	-4	Why does she have to ensure that, though? Like I said, you are bringing a pragmatic element in here: A parent can rescind their obligation to take care of their child as it is their choice, but since neglecting it outright wouldn't be a very nice thing to do, they should make sure it is taken care of first.I don't see how it's any different to say that a woman can rescind her right to take care of a foetus as it is her choice, but since crushing it with a pair of forceps and pulling it piece by piece out of her body isn't very nice, she should wait till the foetus can survive outside her and then give it to someone else to care for.	0.9995854496955872
5	z3r0shade	29	The difference is whether or not she has to risk her own life, health, and wellbeing. It's a conflict of rights. In the case of a child having to be dropped off or given up for adoption, the child has a right to life and the mother does not have to risk her own health, well-being and potentially her life in order to give it up for adoption, as such the child's right to not be abused trumps her right to neglect it. In the case of a fetus, it has no right to the woman's body and has no right to continue to use her body nor the right to force her to risk her life for it. It's the exact same reason why we can arrest a parent for neglecting their child until it starves but we can't legally force them to donate an organ to their dying child	0.9997954964637756
6	klemnodd	7	I think you deserve a delta for this, especially for forced donation which is exactly what making her carry to term against her will is.	0.9999845027923584
7	RMSOT	4	But you are weighing 'forced donation' against a human life. I bet you make the exact opposite argument for socialized healthcare. The child is only party that did not consent. Sex carries a risk of pregnancy, a cost paid for by both consenting parties (enforced by courts). We can mitigate that risk as much as possible, but once it becomes a matter of lifestyle vs life (ie, pregnancy happens) you can't possibly morally defend that. You do not have the moral authority to decide that someone would be better off not existing. 'it would be neglected and unwanted' is not justification for snuffing out unique, innocent human existence.	0.0005306605016812682
8	klemnodd	1	I am not arguing morality (I somewhat agree with you) I was stating that that was a good analogy. As for consenting, while yes pregnancy is a risk, it doesn't mean the parent gave consent to it, in the same vein that you wouldn't consent to a car accident even though it is an inherent risk. Yes I am for socialism but I don't view it as a forced donation (because that assumes the belief that your true effort is valued more than others, we are not born equal). I view it as a solution in the same way a conservative views abolishing minimum wage (but that is for another conversation).	0.998813271522522
9	RMSOT	3	You don't consent to an accident, you consent to totality of your actions. As in, if you want to drive your car from A to B you must also accept the reality that driving has risks. If you do drive, you assume that the risk/reward ratio is worthwhile. Life is risk/reward, and that's okay. If you didn't assume any risk, you would never want to leave the house. However when you start altering the risk/reward by infringing on the rights of other, its immoral. Banks did this in 2008, private reward, socialized risk. Student loans, same thing, the government guarantees them so why not loan out to the world? In this case, you are eliminating the risks by killing the fetus. That's maximally infringing on the rights of a unique human life.	0.215870201587677
10	klemnodd	1	Valid points. But at what point do you assign rights to a being and at what point do those rights supersede the mothers? At what point does an unconscious life have the same rights as a conscious one? One that can have existential thoughts. Also why would it concern anybody but the actual parties involved? Is the private/socialized risk about abortion or socialism? I'm not seeing the connection because I don't see the socialized risk of abortion but I do see it in an unwanted child.	0.466777503490448
11	RMSOT	1	I don't know when to assign personhood, but I would error on the side of preserving life when the answer is unclear. If I had to I could pragmatically agree on outlawing abortion after the 1st trimester. Why am I concerned? Because the fundamental role of a government in a free society is to protect against others infringing on natural rights of life, liberty and property. Therefore, the government does have a role in stopping thieves, murders, slavers, and abortionists. Maybe I connected things a little loosely. Socialism is socialized risk, private upside. Socializing risk is roughly equivalent to removing it (you are one small data point), tragedy of the commons. I can treat my body like a turd, eat lots of shitty food and socialize the cost of consequences. From this I draw that cheating the risk/reward ratio by use of government (socialized) or by infringing on the rights of others ('legal stealing' or 'legal murder, late term abortion') is immoral.	0.10453931242227554
12	klemnodd	1	So it's a social decision to force a person to bare a child against their will but there is no social obligation to assist in its development?	0.990284264087677
13	RMSOT	2	Not in a free society. You were free to assume the risks of sex and you must also be free to bear the consequences. It's a social decision to decide that certain natural (God-given, nature given, w/e) rights exist and exactly those rights must be protected. One of those is the right to not be deprived of life. Once you exist, no one has the right to actively destroy you. Isn't existence the most interesting thing you ever done?We (or should) force people to bare all sorts of burdens of their actions. If you allow people the benefits of their actions, but remove the burdens you create moral hazard. Humans are shitty with moral hazard. That being said, we need to expedite the male birth control shot to the balls ASAP. It lasts 8 years and you can wash it out before that in 3 months. I forget the name, but its under trials in India.	0.9875979423522949
