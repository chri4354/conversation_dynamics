0	t3_5rb7bq	jessebanjo		"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9972221851348877	0.8530923128128052	0.3434939384460449
1	t1_dd5zpy2	thisisallme		"You misunderstand free will. Free will isn't something that you are given or just have, barring any other circumstance. Free will is the ability to do anything you want. It's not fate, it's choosing your actions. You are then \\defending yourself\\"" against either a rapist, who chose to do that, or something that had no decision to even come into being. There's no comparison."""	0.9623624086380005	0.7540412545204163	0.3247462213039398
2	t1_dd65vso	jessebanjo		my point is that both the rapist and fetus are where they are and doing what they are doing due to universal circumstances. Therefore, our consideration of a person's right to protect themselves from the effects of another person potentially being inside of them should be indifferent to their origin.	0.9787373542785645	0.9787373542785645	0.0039327144622802734
