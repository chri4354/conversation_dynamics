"t3_5shhx3"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I'm making this CMV because I've noticed that my views on abortion don't really line up with either of the two main viewpoints on it (although they're much closer to a pro-choice viewpoint than a pro-life one). This isn't so much one specific view as it is a collection of related views regarding abortion.I'll specifically list the things that I believe and the things that I don't believe. I think it's good to address both sides because we live in a world where a simple sentence like \\"I support gun rights\\" has people immediately jumping to conclusions about your views on everything from race relations and gay marriage to economic standpoints and foreign policy. Addressing both sides helps to avoid people reaching incorrect conclusions.Important note: For the purposes of this discussion I am writing this with the assumption in mind that a fetus at any point in development is equivalent to a human life. I **do not** believe this and I will explain my reasons for making this assumption in the \\"Things I don't believe\\" section.Also, I am from the U.S.A. and I will be writing this with specific regards to the United States. When I say 'government', 'society', etc. I mean the U.S. government or U.S. society.**Things that I believe***View*: Abortions help society.*Reasoning*: There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies. For starters, every human who is born takes up a lot of resources, and produces a lot of pollution. The average American is responsible for roughly 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita)). Essentially, humans are bad for the environment so less humans is a good thing if we consider climate change to be important.Additionally, unwanted babies are more likely to grow up in bad situations (since they were unwanted), and are more likely to become criminals detrimental to society, or if not criminals then people on welfare which is also detrimental to society. Now yes, it is possible that some aborted baby would have grown up to be the next Einstein. But since it is more likely that they will end up being detrimental to society, I see no reason why we should assume that the less likely of two outcomes will happen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Women of any age, citizenship status, etc. should be able to get an abortion from any abortion clinic for free, no questions asked.*Reasoning*: In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 ([source](https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2014/06/much-abortion-cost-draft-theresas/)). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. If you oppose a doctor simply informing their patient of the facts, then you oppose spreading knowledge and have no place in any sort of philosophical discussion. If you still do not like the fact that the woman may be more likely to choose abortion when they are more aware of the facts, then maybe you should rethink your position on the matter because when people gain knowledge on the subject they become more likely to disagree with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.*Reasoning*: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.Also not that this is fundamentally different from things such as breastfeeding or a mother simply providing food for her child. Breast milk serves no purpose to the mother, and the nutrients stored in food do not belong to anyone until they consume that food. In this way, a fetus in the womb truly does steal nutrients from the mother. A baby does not steal nutrients from the mother, but rather uses nutrients that were either useless to the mother (breastmilk), or provided by the mother as a gift and therefore never the mother's in the first place.----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.*Reasoning*: This point will probably cause the most controversy. Many people will disagree with this because late in the pregnancy, the fetus would be able to survive on its own if it were surgically removed from the woman in the proper manner. However, I believe that just because it would be able to survive on its own does not change the fact that it is still essentially a parasite and the woman still deserves the right to remove that parasite from her body. The fetus, while in the womb, is still feeding off the nutrients of the mother (regardless of whether or not it could survive outside the womb), and therere should be treated as a parasite.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Things that I do not believe***View*: Women should be forced to have abortions.*Reasoning*: This one is obvious but it must be stated, I do not believe that any woman, for any reason, should EVER be forced into having an abortion. Encouraging them is fine, informing them is fine, forcing them is not.--------------------------------------*View*: A fetus's life is equivalent to a human life*Reasoning*: As I mentioned earlier, I want this discussion to be had with the assumption in mind that fetus's are equivalent to human lives. However, I do not believe this is true. The reason I wish for this to be the assumption is that pro-lifers tend to get hung up on this which I know will lead to a meaningless discussion because I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were **uneqivocally proven** that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to \\"I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way.\\"----------------------------------*View*: All killing is bad*Reasoning*: There are many forms of killing that are generally considered acceptable. Soldiers kill other soldiers in wartime, people are allowed to kill in self-defense, and criminals are executed due to their crimes. All of these are perfectly legal forms of killing, and though some are controversial most would agree that at least one of the three is justified. I believe that abortion is another one of these types of killing. This is also why I don't care whether the fetus is a human or not - I view it as a legally and morally justified form of killing.While I am interested in having my view changed, I am also interested in simply having a discussion on the topic.

"t1_ddgiql6"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; I am fairly sure that the core of pretty much every view you explain here is still 100% that you believe that a fetus (at all points from conception to live birth) is not valued as a human life by you and in fact better classified as a parasite, like a mosquito. I don't get how you are asking people to look past that, or to not get \\"hung up\\" on that fact. That ABSOLUTELY IS the conversation we are having when discussing abortion in general, and we cannot sneak past the difference in belief.I think you've misunderstood me here. I wasn't saying it isn't an important discussion point. I said not to get hung up on it because I wanted to avoid arguing about whether a fetus is a human or not. I don't care if it is. I don't care if it isn't. It would make no difference on my views. So since I don't care if it is a human life, I said \\"let's just assume that it IS a human life\\" to appease the pro-lifers who would get hung up on that. I wanted the discussion to be about \\"Assuming that a fetus is a human life, is abortion still an OK thing?\\" And my answer to that question is yes.; If you did think the fetus to be a human life (I am not sure how you can honestly sympathize with that), are you suggesting that killing a human life at 5 months living in the womb would be different than killing it at 5 months living in someone living room?That's exactly what I'm suggesting.; Would you kill a 6-month-old child if the husband leaves and supporting the child now doesn't make financial sense, like you might for a child in the womb for 7 months?No I would not because at that point adoption is an option. Adoption is not an option for a fetus. I actually awarded a delta to someone who played with the idea of some hypothetical surgical way of doing a sort of fetus adoption because it partially changed my view (regarding my terminology), but with current technology I still fully support all of the ideas I wrote.; I tend to think, that both morally and legally, if a fetus is considered a human life, and valued as a human life, then it would or should be protected as such, no?This was more what I mean when I mentioned soldiers and criminals. My point was not that a fetus is equivalent to these things. My only point was that there are already several situations where we expressly *don't* protect human life.; What are your thoughts when someone says that if population control and unwanted babies is the real issue here, what about not having sex to create more babies at all?I mean ideally that's a great idea. Good luck convincing the human race to stop having sex. People have been trying to do that for years and have gotten nowhere really. I don't think that that's a viable solution.Compare it to driving a car. If you want fewer people to die in car crashes, the solution is not to try to convince people to drive safer. The better solution is to engineer a safer car. Human error exists just like human instinct exists. You can't get rid of it. So solutions need to come from places that we DO have control of. For example, making safer cars, or allowing abortions."
"t1_ddh4uky"	"SLUnatic85"	NA	"I think for me it would have to be when the mother feels the baby move inside her on its own. That has to be so incredible. Ill never have that feeling. I was with my sister the first time her first born kicked. My sister in law swears she could put a remote on her stomach and the little girl would kick it off. I think for a lot of people it's seeing and hearing the love ultrasound. That heartbeat... But I can surely imagine for many it doesn't happen till the baby comes out and they can see it or hold it in their arms. But once you know in your heart the child is alive and is yours. That's what we are all arguing about. Once it is your child in your own eyes, you'd be a murderer to end it's life. I agree no one can tell you exactly when that time is but that's what you are talking about without meaning to.I don't know if you have been around newborn babies or have any of your own, but they are honestly just as parasitic weeks after birth as weeks before. They latch on to their mothers breasts and literally suck out nutrients, hardly able to see. It's not uncommon to have to clear their throat and mouth of blood shit and other bodily fluids after birth. Someone needs to physically cut the umbilical cord and tie it off or it can get infected. More then we might hope of babies need to be incubated or on breathing machines for a few hours or days, especially if they decide to come out early. Many for months can't eat solid foods even if they could find it. It's not uncommon for a newborn baby to cry itself beyond exaustion if it can feel the mothers familiar warmth and hear her specific heartbeat from its memories of the womb. Your parasite definition is odd and inhumane sounding but true to an extent. But it doesn't have to do with when a life is human and worth protecting for many. Your war and self defense idea is not relevant to an innocent child for most people including myself. A baby is not forced on a woman 99+% of the time and it's crazy to suppose otherwise. Making a baby is a known consequence of an act we chose to do. To say keeping a baby inside the mother is risking her life is not valid to me either. A human body is designed to reproduce and carry a child. Accidents and sad situations happen, as they do otherwise in life. But such is the way of things. I don't need to change your view. I think I understand it much better know and thanks for the clarification. But it rubbed me the wrong way when you stated that it doesn't matter if you think the baby is a living human or not. Because it does for many people and to start an argument based on otherwise is not going to go anywhere most of the time. Own your beliefs on when you think a human life is worth protecting. You are not in the wrong. It's been great. I do appreciate people being so open and honest."
"t1_ddgw4k6"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"&gt; We definitely disagree on that you can take the value of the human life out of the equation.I'm not taking the value of a human life out of the equation. I have factored it into the equation, given it plenty of thought, and I have still reached the conclusion that abortion is a net positive thing.; I think that I am understanding that you believe at the point of birth, coming out of the womb or cutting the umbilical cord or at some other point you hesitate to define, the value of the life becomes different.I'm not hesitant to define it. It's when the child is born. 10 seconds before birth it is not equivalent to a human, 10 seconds after birth it is. I have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, that is where I draw it.; Something has changed for you, I am just unclear as to what. The thing that has changed is that the baby switches from feeding off the mother directly to feeding off other sources. Those sources do not have to come from the biological mother after birth. Before birth, they do.; you will have to wait for the child to come out in order to give it awayAnd this carries a risk to the mother's life. She should not be forced to take that risk for something she doesn't want anyway. Especially when it helps the rest of society out too.; Are you saying that if giving a person away instantaneously to eliminate a problem or the potential for future problems is not an option, then it is morally OK to kill the person?Honestly I don't think it's morally OK for society to attach that person to you in the first place. You call it \\"giving a person away\\", but that wouldn't fly for any other person. I couldn't just show up to your home and start eating your food and say \\"I live here now\\". There are systems in place to remove me from your life if I tried to do that. Just like there are systems in place to remove the born child from your life (adoption).But if those systems went away, what would you do? If cops weren't a thing and I just barged into your house and simply wouldn't leave, then I think you'd be justified in killing me. So yeah, it might sound harsh but if adoption weren't a thing then yes, I think that there are situations where it would be morally OK for the mother to kill the baby. Animals do it all the time, and for good reasons. If the mother had to choose between her own life, or the life of her child, I wouldn't blame her for choosing herself. I hope this not only answers your question, but also explains why I don't see that as selfish.; It might be more relvant to say you are allowed to kill a person post-birth, only if to protect others or to punish them, but pre-birth other reasons can apply.That's actually exactly what I was getting at. My point was that we tend to agree that there are exceptional circumstances in which killing can be justified.; But IF a person truly does believe that having an abortion is killing a person, taking the life of your child (I really think you are not relating to that concept) then it's pretty friggin' crazy to think that one would kill that child in order to avoid having to raise them, if they could have just not had sex or used a condom to likely prevent the issue.And if a person really truly feels that way, then it should be on them to remain celibate. I'm not advocating for forced abortions. If a woman doesn't want a baby but becomes pregnant anyway, she should have the option. But if she thinks that's murdering a baby, she can opt to not have that abortion. No one's going to force her.; There are laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe driving to keep people from dying.And in my opinion there should be laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe sex and to keep people from having unwanted pregnancies. Sex education is a thing that I fully support and think should be expanded. Just like driver's education. But we both know that even if we had 10 years of those classes, accidents will still happen.; If what you are saying is true, then why are people getting punished all over the world for driving unsafely?People don't/shouldn't get punished for driving unsafely if it truly was an unavoidable accident. Just like people shouldn't be punished for having an accidental pregnancy.I actually think the analogy is pretty good."
"t1_ddgr6m5"	"SLUnatic85"	NA	"We definitely disagree on that you can take the value of the human life out of the equation. If a person thinks that life starts at conception, or at heartbeat, or at brain activity, then a fetus, a 2-year-old, a 27-year-old, and a 103-year-old are all living human beings. In most known societies there has been some moral, and often legal, system in place to protect human life (setting aside racial or other discriminatory feelings of a time). One may say it's OK to kill this bad person to protect the population, or oneself. One might say it's OK to kill a person to punish for an equal or greater crime. One might say that ending your own life is OK if you make that decision. It gets even grayer when you bring in protecting quality of life or torture... These are situations, though, in which you are weighing human lives in an equation. In almost all cases it is not on the same level of killing a dog or mosquito or tree or other non-human life. In fact generally the driving idea is to protect the right to human life. Perhaps I am off base, but that is absolutely what most people who are against abortion and even some that are for instances of abortion are considering. The value of human life.I think that I am understanding that you believe at the point of birth, coming out of the womb or cutting the umbilical cord or at some other point you hesitate to define, the value of the life becomes different. Either because it becomes a living human life, or maybe that we can see and hear it, or some other reason. You would take the life of a fetus at 8 months in the womb because the woman decides it would make her life shittier, but you would not approve if she killed the baby at three months old in it's crib for the same reason. Something has changed for you, I am just unclear as to what. For the record, if you get pregnant and don't want the child, you can absolutely put the child (or child-to-be I guess) up for adoption. Yes, it is a process like any adoption, not always fun or convenient and of course you will have to wait for the child to come out in order to give it away You might even risk developing some attachment, but you can do it. I am not sure what you were talking about, or how it relates to whether or not it is OK to kill a person. Are you saying that if giving a person away instantaneously to eliminate a problem or the potential for future problems is not an option, then it is morally OK to kill the person? That is an extremely selfish line of thinking but hopefully I am misinterpretting.Your murder/war/punishment argument really is not relevant when your opinion of whether or not it is OK to take the life changes at time of birth and is not dependent of protecting a life or the consequence of the taking of that life. It might be more relvant to say you are allowed to kill a person post-birth, only if to protect others or to punish them, but pre-birth other reasons can apply.I know that sex is not something we can stop. That is an over the top question I have wondered on that makes me wonder, and I personally struggle with the depth. But IF a person truly does believe that having an abortion is killing a person, taking the life of your child (I really think you are not relating to that concept) then it's pretty friggin' crazy to think that one would kill that child in order to avoid having to raise them, if they could have just not had sex or used a condom to likely prevent the issue. I know there are a million other factors here, it's a conversation starter. I was just curious.You talk about cars... I think it's a lousy comparion and far from apples to apples, but sure. I'll bite. And guess what? There are laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe driving to keep people from dying. If what you are saying is true, then why are people getting punished all over the world for driving unsafely? We cannot eliminate human error but we enforce laws specifically to create environments that protect human life. That's, like, the point of most laws. We have laws that protect human life in and around moving vehicles, so why not for being unborn or not able to be adopted for a few more months? I am not saying that I want abortion to be illegal with this comment, I am just also comparing it to the same car thought you laid out for me."
"t1_ddg8chx"	"SLUnatic85"	NA	"I don't get why you say you are not pro-choice. You lose me there... but I won't dwell on that, you thought of a creative new way to start the conversation. :) well played.----------------I get a little confused at your comparison of killing the fetus to killing an enemy combatant or otherwise. If you believe a fetus is a parasite and not valued as a human life than you likely would not categorize it with these forms forms of legal taking of human life in self defense, execution as punishment, or even forms of euthanasia, right? I don;t want to put words in your mouth... but you have already explained how valuing human life is different than that of an animal or parasite so to make the comparison later seems odd. You should compare abortion more to stepping on a bug or pulling off a leech and throwing it into the garbage. Even putting my dog down might have more moral hardship than removing a parasite or mosquito, so keep the line at human v. not human for simplicity. -----------------------------But to the rest of your post... I am fairly sure that the core of pretty much every view you explain here is still 100% that you believe that a fetus (at all points from conception to live birth) is not valued as a human life by you and in fact better classified as a parasite, like a mosquito. I don't get how you are asking people to look past that, or to not get \\"hung up\\" on that fact. That ABSOLUTELY IS the conversation we are having when discussing abortion in general, and we cannot sneak past the difference in belief. To try to defend any one of your views in conversation with any person who believes otherwise about the value of the life of that fetus is going to be tough. So I guess just know that. I also personally think your parasite till birth view has some room for argument. Does the birth have to be natural or can it be cut out (c-section or other early procedures for troubled fetuses) to make it a human life? What if the fetus is born naturally or otherwise and then requires life support to remain alive due to complications? At what point in life do you suppose that a parasite/fetus/baby/child DOES start producing health benefits for the mother while depending on their food and other supporting functions and energy for survival? If someone walks up and stabs a woman in the stomach to end the life of her fetus but she lives, how do you judge that situation? If these are going to be your hard lines you should consider that a two year old will die if left completely alone or without parental type support and feeding 100% of the time. -------------------------Then you seem to claim (as your closing point, maybe coincidentally) that your view does not depend on that you think a fetus is not a human life, and a women should be able to kill it either way (I assume not just specifically if the mother's life is physically threatened by the fetus' living). I find that extremely hard to believe, given how you set up your parasite beliefs. Care to elaborate on how that might work? If you did think the fetus to be a human life (I am not sure how you can honestly sympathize with that), are you suggesting that killing a human life at 5 months living in the womb would be different than killing it at 5 months living in someone living room? Would you kill a 6-month-old child if the husband leaves and supporting the child now doesn't make financial sense, like you might for a child in the womb for 7 months? Is finding out at 1 and a half years old the the kid has downs syndrome the same a finding out at 6 months and a sound reason to terminate? Would you think it any more or less dependent on the parent for survival? Any more or less defenseless? Any more or less a risk to the mother or others (like in wartime or legally acceptable self-defense situations)? Any more or less deserving of human rights or protections as a human? I tend to think, that both morally and legally, if a fetus is considered a human life, and valued as a human life, then it would or should be protected as such, no?--------------------------------If you have read this far I may as well ask another question. lol. What are your thoughts when someone says that if population control and unwanted babies is the real issue here, what about not having sex to create more babies at all? And this is coming from a dude who loves sex so don't be afraid to bash the idea, haha. I only mean to say that honestly there is a MUCH easier solution to having all these unwanted babies or controlling population growth than deciding on when it is or isn't OK to kill them as a human life or not, and it would be to not create them in the first place, right? Food for thought...I honestly believe that the legality and practices of abortion or the regulations that surround it should be decided completely by women who have been consciously pregnant, otherwise your vote on the matter doesn't count, LOL! (I am not a women nor have I had kids yet FYI). Just a thought I have had as it is a hugely complicated topic. ----------------------I wish you the best though, there is a lot of good comments here. I really do enjoy conversations like this. I hope you learned something or achieved whatever it is you set out to achieve. :) Feel free to fire back!"
