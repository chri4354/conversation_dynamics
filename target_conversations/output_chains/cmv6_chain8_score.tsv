1	t1_dghj9oc	Reason_is_Key		"Regarding your first point, what would you say constitutes as harm? With regards to rape, I think that you are faced with either forcing a fully developed human to do something against her will or killing an unborn and not conscious potential future adult. In this scenario, you are faced with having to pick the lesser of the two evils. Yet, I agree with your second point; my principle doesn't hold for extraordinary circumstances, such as rape, which is why I am awarding you a !delta I agree that killing in self defense is sometimes necessary, but it remains immoral in my opinion. It, along with abortion in some cases, is a \\necessary evil\\"" -- murder is immoral in all cases but sometimes justifiable. I do not agree with the postmodernist approach to subjective morality; there are some actions, such as murder, rape, etc., which are immoral regardless of circumstances. When discussing morality, I tend to view things through a Kantian lens, in that I try to universalized actions in order to determine their moral status. Abortion, if universalized, is a blatant immorality."""	0.6508013606071472	0.5771033763885498	0.43458518385887146

If we had the ability to turn any skin cell into a full adult human (through genetic intervention) it seems absurd to say that scratching my arm is immoral killing. Harms only count as harms when a being can actually be harmed, not potentially... Second, your standard is inconsistently applied if abortion is allowed in cases of rape. Why should the circumstances under which a being came into existence matter to the value of that being? If fetus A has a right to life, it is unclear why fetus B doesn't have a right to life if the only difference between the two is that fetus B was conceived by rape.Thirdly, even if a being has a full right to life, that is not enough to ensure that abortion is immoral. After all, killing in self-defense isn't wrong (at least in my view). Have you heard of Judith Thomson's violinist argument about the distinction between the right to life and the right to be sustained?I am also deeply unclear on what \\promoting abortion\\"" is. Is it saying that it is a choice that women can make the same as promoting it?"""	0.029156021773815155	0.2057102769613266	0.2835581302642822
