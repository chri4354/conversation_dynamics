"t1_dghhtl8"	"SchiferlED"	"13"	"&gt;The fetus is a human fetus and should therefore have the right of every other human not to be murdered; everyone should have the opportunity to live.It has the right to live, but not the right to be inside of the woman when she doesn't want it inside her. If the natural result of removing it from her body is the death of the fetus, then that is just an unfortunate circumstance, not murder. \\"Right to live\\" does not mean \\"everything possible must be done to keep it alive, or else it's murder\\".;Many will say that a fetus is not human, yet I would argue that it is because of its genetic makeup. Most people would characterize \\"being human\\" as exiting the vagina; I disagree. Being human, giraffe, ape, etc., is dependent on one's genetic makeup rather than what it comes out of.Human genetics is not the issue here. If anything \\"personhood\\" is the issue, although that still does not get around my first point. The skin on your back is \\"human\\" but you don't bat an eye at someone who scratches their back and kills human cells. That's because those cells alone are not a \\"person\\". Many argue that the fetus is not developed enough to be a \\"person\\" yet, so there is no issue with an abortion."
"t1_dghjf2m"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"The woman, unless in cases of rape, has made the choice to have unprotected sex, which she knew could potentially lead to the development of human life. Therefore, the baby has the right to be inside of the mother.Killing a skin cell, in my view, is not immoral as it does not have the potential to become human life. A fetus, on the other hand, does."
"t1_dghk1mv"	"CoyotePatronus"	"11"	"&gt;Therefore, the baby has the right to be inside of the mother.No. It doesn't matter if the situation is of the mother's direct cause. In no other situation, even when a person is at fault for another person's condition, does the right to life trump someone else's right to bodily autonomy. That is, I make a choice to drive a car, knowing there's a small chance of an accident. If that accident occurs, if someone else is on the verge of death because of my direct choice, that still doesn't give them the right to violate my bodily autonomy, even to save their own life. The mother making a choice to have sex (pregnancy can occur even with protected sex, mind) does not translate into consent to carry a baby, nor does it remove her right to bodily autonomy if she does become pregnant."
"t1_dghkcmw"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"I do not quite understand your car accident example; would you mind explaining it a bit more? The intrinsic purpose of sex in all forms of animal life is to reproduce; engaging in the act whose purpose is to create life, in my opinion, creates an implicit agreement to harbor that life (if conception occurs)."
"t1_dghl9qu"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; engaging in the act whose purpose is to create life, in my opinion, creates an implicit agreement to harbor that life (if conception occurs).Well there ya go - not all people believe that. That's just your opinion. That most certainly is not the way society operates legally, and not morally either for at least half of all Americans (without looking it up)."
"t1_dghnv3b"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"Exactly. I'm just sharing an opinion; if my view was the same as \\"at least half of Americans\\", then what would be the point for me to ask you all to change my view? The fact that not many people agree with me does not make my opinion any less valid"
"t1_dgho4f0"	"[deleted]"	NA	"The problem is you're trying to control other people (through discouragement and/or restrictions) based on that opinion."
