With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"

Obviously men can't have children but then isn't it sexist that women can have children but men can't? If reasons and intents don't matter we should ban all child-making."
"t1_dgcmg2y"	"ralph-j"	"35"	"&gt; The argument is that it doesn't only affect women so it's not sexist in intent or practice. The argument is about bodily integrity. If society were to force women to stay pregnant against their will, that would by definition be sexist, because men obviously cannot be forced to stay pregnant.The fact that men might face a disadvantage in another area doesn't change whether forcing women to stay pregnant, is sexist.; Obviously men can't have children but then isn't it sexist that women can have children but men can'tThat's not something we can change, can we?; If reasons and intents don't matter we should ban all child-making.Reasons and intents do matter. It just doesn't excuse an action or law from being sexist, if it's sexist due to its effects."
"t1_dgawxsv"	"ralph-j"	"35"	"&gt; I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomyIt might not be sexist *in its intent*, but it is sexist by its effects. If the right to an abortion is denied, this uniquely disadvantages only women, since men obviously don't suffer from this disadvantage. Therefore it would by definition be sexist, even if unintentionally so."

"t1_dgd2r9v"	"ralph-j"	"35"	"&gt; No one is forcing women to remain pregnant against their will. What they are doing is forcing women to not kill their babies.Sounds like a distinction without a difference.; Opponents of abortion believe the fetus is a child that deserves to not be killed. Since both men and women are banned from killing babies it is not sexist. It doesn't matter that women have an extra way to kill babies, both men and women are banned from killing babies.Only women are forced to forgo their bodily integrity and keep their bodies available for use by another being. A fetus would essentially have more rights than any born person in the world: in no other situation do we grant another person the right to the (forced) use of someone else's body.You cannot even force a parent to donate an organ, or even just a small amount of blood, to save their (already born) baby, even if that's the only way the baby can survive. Their right to bodily autonomy protects them from being forced to give up organs or blood against their will."
