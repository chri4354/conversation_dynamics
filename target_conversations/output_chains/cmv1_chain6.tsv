"t3_7j5asr"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"A zygote/fetus is a human being --&gt; It is immoral to kill human beings --&gt; Thus an abortion is immoral1) There is plenty of reason to suggest that a zygote/fetus is not a person, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't a human being2) Even among pro-choice advocates, most probably would agree that it is immoral to kill human beingsIn order to conclude that an abortion is a morally neutral act, one most disagree with points 1 and/or 2, and I can't see any reasonable way to do that.- We refer to the zygote/fetus as \\"the child\\", \\"the baby\\", etc... Not \\"it\\" or \\"the zygote\\" or \\"the thing\\".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

"t1_dr454j0"	"Prep_Coin_Concede"	NA	"Like the Christian Church used to believe in abortion!"
"t1_dr4aoa4"	"jaimedieuetilmaime"	NA	"I’ve never heard this before—do you know if a source to back up your claim? As far as I’ve ever researched, even early Christians walked the streets of Rome digging through the trash for abandoned baby girls so much that there were rumors the Christians were eating them (mixed with odd rumors about communion and why else would someone want to save a worthless infant girl?)."
"t1_dr4iyy0"	"WorkSucks135"	NA	"The bible gives instructions on how to force a potentially unfaithful wife to abort.https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+5%3A11-31&amp;version=NIV"
"t1_dr4kujv"	"jaimedieuetilmaime"	NA	"Fascinating! I’d read that passage many times before, but hadn’t considered it could be about an abortion—the only translation that even suggests abortion is the 2011 NIV. After some quick research, it seems the passage is ambiguous in its wording. Contemporary sources to the time of the temple seem to say the “bitter water” was holy water used in the temple rites mixed with soil from the temple floor (which would not cause an abortion), however. It seems like the standard position from scholars today is that it was a test for wives whose husbands had reason to suspect infidelity that required direct intervention from God to work. If the woman was unfaithful, God would know and would cause her to sicken in some way (some people postulate her stomach would bloat or wizen, or her uterus would prolapse, or she would turn pale and ill, or her thigh/ stomach would wizen.... the wording here is ambiguous at best). If she had remained faithful, her husband could have ease of mind. What with the other passages in the Bible about how God knows, crafts, and loves children in the womb, I would say it is an incorrect interpretation of the passage to suggest it was a forced or accepted abortion even at the time (considering the rest of the Bible as a hermeneutic). If you’d like to explore why I believe this is the correct interpretation:[Here’s the verse in Hebrew](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/numbers/5-27.htm) [Here are some well-accepted commentaries](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/numbers/5-27.htm) [And here’s a quick article written by some pastors](https://www.gotquestions.org/Numbers-abortion.html) Thanks so much for the input—I always enjoy exploring topics like this more!"
"t1_dr4lmq0"	"WorkSucks135"	NA	"&gt;“bitter water” was holy water used in the temple rites mixed with soil from the temple floor (which would not cause an abortion), however. I disagree that it wouldn't have a high likelyhood of of causing a miscarriage/abortion. Contracting food poisoning, such as listeria and e coli, is basically an automatic miscarriage in the first trimester. Sure a random soil sample from outside might not get you sick, but we are talking about a temple floor of an ancient *agrarian* society. Everyone who comes through there has feet covered in feces. The dirt would literally be full of shit. This was also from a time when they were likely still slaughtering livestock in the temple."
"t1_dr3pzu6"	"brock_lee"	"18"	"&gt; It is immoral to kill human beings * Is it immoral to kill someone who is attacking you and seems intent on killing you?* Is it immoral to execute a convicted mass murderer?* Is it immoral to kill the enemy in war?If you answer NO to any of these questions, then the blanket \\"It is immoral to kill human beings\\" is not universal, and there may be a way to explain abortion as not being immoral. I fully realize that a fetus is \\"innocent\\" and \\"not an enemy combatant\\", but that is not my point. My point is that it is not valid to say \\"It is immoral to kill human beings\\" so it is possible that it is not immoral to have an abortion."
"t1_dr3q584"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; Is it immoral to kill someone who is attacking you and seems intent on killing you?When it isn't necessary and you intentionally killed them when you didn't need to? Yes.; Is it immoral to execute a convicted mass murderer?Yes; Is it immoral to kill the enemy in war?YesI'm not sure how this disputes the point though, it seems to confirm it actually."
"t1_dr3qat3"	"brock_lee"	"18"	"I wanted to see if you felt that killing humans was immoral universally. The problem is, if you do, then I don't know what might change your view. Morals don't seem to be absolute. What is immoral to one person can be completely morally justifiable to another. There is no final arbiter of morality."
