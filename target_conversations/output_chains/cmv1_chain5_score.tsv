Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

3	t1_dr5zjv7	Commissar_Bolt		You're arguing solely using biased branding and emotional phrasing now. I can just as easily argue that the pro-choice movement should be properly branded pro-abortion or fetus slayers, it makes no difference beyond emotional response. From the perspective of pro-life individuals, the agenda is preventing the murder of unborn children. So instead of continuing to argue semantics, let me ask you this - can you think of a situation in which you would perform an immoral act? Would that inherently weigh on your conscience? And would you inherently have responsibility for an act of which you were guilty?	0.9456609487533569	0.6596099734306335	0.44381868839263916

I can just as easily argue that the pro-choice movement should be properly branded pro-abortion or fetus slayers, it makes no difference beyond emotional response.What I'm saying is that I'm not choosing the words for the emotional impact. I'm choosing the words for their *accuracy*. The emotional impact is not a reaction to the words, it's a reaction to the reality I'm pointing to with them.The pro-choice side is *not* pro-abortion. They are not excited about getting more and more abortions to happen. It's pro-bodily-sovereignty, which, yes, sometimes includes killing a child to remove it for the mother. But the *point* is not to kill the child, the point is to not violate the woman's bodily sovereignty.The agenda is not *just* preventing the murder of gestation-age children, it's forcing women to gestate the children against their will to accomplish that goal, because it's the only way the goal can be accomplished. When that's not what's on the line, there is no disagreement between the groups. So it's accurate to call it anti-choice, or if you like pro-forced-gestation.The point I've been arguing is that it's immoral to try to argue from this perspective, that the woman must gestate the fetus against her will. It's her body, end of story, other people around her should be telling her it's her right to make her own choice about her body and answering any questions she has, not expressing their opinions about what she should do with her own body. Talking about how she owes the fetus because otherwise she/he will die is guilting the woman into giving her very body up to do something she doesn't want to do. It's immoral in other situations, and it's immoral here. Do you think the way people treated Emmie in that story I linked was not immoral? That's directly what lead to her death. Surely an agenda so concerned with life would be alarmed by and fight against this?	0.6890029311180115	0.5475341081619263	0.43199440836906433

I already agreed, yes Emmie's case is appalling - why are you beating a dead horse? My point, and OP's point, is that it is also immoral to end a potential life. We can argue back and forth about which choice is worse and who is pushing what agenda, but the point is that there is no moral high ground here. Both sides are wrong, and both sides are right - the worst thing you can do is refuse to listen to one side's arguments and draw a line in the sand.

And no, nobody stops trying to do good things; I also encourage people to take sex more seriously and carefully. Especially men. We invented birth control and teach people how to use it effectively.Again, very factually: I don't think it's ever right to ask a woman to gestate a child against her will, not even if that fetus will die, and I think it's immoral to try to guilt her into it at all, whether or not her life is in danger, because that's not respecting her bodily sovereignty. I don't think she should feel obligated to carry the pregnancy if she doesn't want to. Yes, it's a life, and yes, she sometimes participated in creating it, but that doesn't mean her body belongs to the new life. And beyond that, laws to give the state control of the woman's body end up harming women in ways that are just silly, like cases of women who couldn't get an abortion procedure even as they were entering sepsis because there was still a heartbeat, or the woman who was imprisoned because she fell down the stairs and people thought she'd tried to miscarry.It just isn't ambiguous to me at all. The woman's body belongs to the woman, full stop. People who try to get her to use it for something she doesn't want to are mistreating her.

But I also feel that it's mistreating me if I get drafted into a war that I don't want to die for. Then again, I don't want my country to lose the war, either. Life throws no-win scenarios at us sometimes. And in my opinion, anytime someone is seriously considering an abortion is one of those. It's not something that should be banned by law or impeded, but it's a stopgap measure until we can find a better way to deal with unwanted pregnancy. Personally, I think that as long as there is a scientific possibility that life begins at conception (which winds up being a matter of opinion) that uncertainty forces us to make the ethical decision of treating a fetus like a human. I can't force that viewpoint on others though. For me, this makes abortion a dilemma, as an immoral but sometimes necessary act.	0.14683140814304352	0.3247964084148407	0.37392479181289673

But for what it is worth, I think that your train of thought is quite the opposite of what I would take. I do not think that the woman should be absolved of guilt for an abortion. But much, much more pressing, I think we should stop absolving fathers, and society as a whole of that burden. I think that the issue needs to be beaten in that every abortion which a mother has, every potential life ended, is a failing of a state which allows children and new mothers to go hungry. I would rather hold onto that guilt, and twist it until it it hurts so much that we change how we deal with children for the better. Guilt shouldn't be something which simply weighs on you with no recourse; it should be a motivator to right what is wrong.

That's why I think this approach that anti-choice advocates take is a wrong way to treat people.

13	t1_dr5hv3r	Commissar_Bolt		&gt; That's not true though. There are other reasons women choose not to allow someone to gestate off their body.I think that I have been unclear, and given you a false argument unintentionally. I apologize. I didn't intend to imply that poverty was the only motivator for getting an abortion. I think, however, that you could broadly categorize motivations into three groups: emotional, financial, and medical. ; I would consider this immoral.I would argue that in a choice between two evils, the end of removing the dilemma justifies some immoral means. But that would be a very different discussion. ; Like the mother in the story who died because she did not abort, leaving her young child and family at her death. Because people told her she shouldn't abort and it was murder.I think that this unfairly maligns my argument, because that seems like a clear misattribution of guilt to me. Unless the mother smoked during pregnancy or in some other way caused harm to the process, she should not be considered guilty in the slightest. Grief, naturally. But blaming her in that scenario is unjust. A better party to feel guilt (since we are being theoretical) should be doctors and scientists, who should respectively review their procedures on how to prevent this outcome and determine better ways to mitigate the illness. As an examples in which I think the woman should feel some guilt and benefit from it, let's take a scenario in which a teenager or freshman in college does not use protection (assuming consent, education, etcetera). She opts to get an abortion primarily for financial and emotional reasons: her parents would not accept that she is pregnant and may disavow her, she may be kicked out school, and having a baby would derail her plans of going to medical school entirely. I think it is just for her to feel guilty in getting an abortion. There are selfish reasons mixed in there. Additionally, her parents should also be considered guilty for causing pressure towards an abortion, the father should receive a measure for failing to use protection, and society as a whole is guilty of failing to protect young mothers. Each has varying degrees of guilt, but it is still present. And simply dumping it all on the woman is a misattribution. And a point on this... there are multiple kinds of guilt. Some are healthy - like the kind that lights a fire in your gut and motivates harder and better work. Some are simply crushing, depressing. I would only consider the former useful. The issue I find is with our handling of guilt in general. We misattribute it far too often, and even when we do attribute it correctly we tend to seek punitive measures instead of seeking to help the guilty party make amends.	0.7508119344711304	0.5617312788963318	0.43594223260879517

It's immortal to treat someone that way. It's ultimately up to her, and her decision should be *informed* and respected.* Abortion is often just a medical matter.
