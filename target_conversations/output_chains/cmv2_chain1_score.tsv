I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.8455479145050049
1	_gweilowizard_	5	The question of the morality of abortion is really only dependent on one thing: does the unborn fetus deserve rights? If the answer to that question is yes, abortion is essentially murder. If the answer is no, abortion is probably fine (though further discussion is needed to define exactly how to treat fetuses).Any valid argument about the morality of abortion has to answer that question.	0.8447892665863037
2	blubox28	2	Deserving rights is not an all or nothing thing. My dog has certain rights but I still have the right to kill him. But even then I am required to do it in as humane way as possible. The further down the evolutionary ladder the fewer right we generally ascribe to the organism in question. The same applies to a fetus as it develops into a baby and is finally born. But even then we do not give all of the same rights to children as we do to adults.	0.13290554285049438

6	blubox28	2	"Basic science? You missed my point entirely. There is no \\basic science\\"" on how you apply a meaningless label. My skin cells are clearly human cells, should they have more rights than my dog? Should my sperm cells be considered \\""human\\"" and be afforded full human rights?

7	mutesa1	1	Your skin cells won't develop into an adult human, and neither will sperm cells that haven't fertilised an egg. Without your interference, a fetus will continue to grow and develop and become a human like us. That doesn't happen with skin cells or the sperm you jizz into a Kleenex.	0.9710284471511841
8	blubox28	1	"Okay, but why would that make a difference to bestowing of human rights? It is almost certainly the case that there is a way to change at least some kind of normal cells into stem cells that can grow into a full human. And you brought the \\related\\"" to argument into it, which still goes through haploid germ cells, so by your own reasoning there is a discontinuity of rights here. But you are still getting hung up by labels. Why does a single human cell get rights but a single dog cell doesn't? There is no other kind of single cell that we accord any rights to whatsoever. The international standard for bioethics on developing human cell experimentation is 14 days. Scientists worldwide basically decided that in the first 14 days it is okay to do what ever you want to a humane zygote as long as you destroy it before the 15th day. In the first 14 days the cells are all undifferentiated cells, with no difference between themselves and any other zygote of any other mammal except for a very small percentage of the DNA."""	0.9360116720199585
9	mutesa1	1	"I'm hung up by labels because labels are incredibly important. Both sides of the abortion debate rest upon with what label does one give to a fetus; a human (pro-life), or a clump of cells (pro-choice)? If it's a human, then the fetus deserves the same basic human rights that you and I enjoy. if it's just a clump of cells, throwing it away in the trash is no different than cleaning up after a masturbation session. I'm also not sure what the relevance of the 14 day thing is to this is. If anything, it weakens the pro-choice position. Why is it not okay to experiment on embryos past 14 days, but it's okay to kill them well past that point? The 14 day limit isn't the same as saying \\okay, now it's actually alive.\\"" It's an arbitrary limit. Switzerland restricts it to 7 days.

You want to have your label mean the difference between one moral set of attributes and another for no apparent reason. Let me put it another way, let us stipulate that this clump of cells is human and that clump of cells is not. Why should that fact be morally relevant in any way?The point I was making with the 14 day limit is that when setting up those rules, there was unanimous agreement that a single human stem cell had no rights whatsoever. And if a single such cell had no rights, two such identical cells could not have them either. For the first 14 days all the cell division results in two identical cells. On the 15th day however, cells started to differentiate and they were no longer identical. Everyone agrees that a new born baby has essentially all human rights.

I don't know where you're from, but in the US there was a huge anti-abortion movement in the 1980s, when this 14-day rule was first put into place.

You don't have to think humans are particularly more important than dogs to have the decency *to care for the young of your own species*. And as a black man, the term human is incredibly important because along with the labelling comes a set of of basic rights. It's not as easy to be pro-choice when the organism being destroyed is called a \\""human\\"", is it? Labeling it a \\""fetus\\"" implicitly or explicitly sets it apart. Ever heard of the term \\""dehumanization?\\"" We don't give single cell organisms special rights mainly because they primarily reproduce asexually, and thus have identical offspring. There are also billions of them, and unless we somehow manage to corral all of them under microscopes, it's impossible to keep track of everyone. Surely this is different than fetuses that we only remove after looking at them on an ultrasound. They aren't going anywhere, they aren't multiplying in the womb, just growing. I'm really curious; do you not believe that fetuses are part of the human species? It's basic biology. The \\""clump of cells\\"" in a woman's womb will become a human. Not an arm, not a dog, not a penis. A human being. What separates a zygote from a clump of random stem cells is that it is *totipotent*. It can give rise to life. It's an important distinction that many people really fail to recognize. If you want to advocate for the protists' and streptococcus' suffrage, more power to you. But right now, every human has a set of basic rights (see the UNDHR). The zygote is a smaller and less developed fetus, just like a child is a smaller and less developed adult. It's just an earlier stage in human development. Children are subject to more restrictions than adults (can't drive, can't drink, can't own weapons, etc.) but they still possess basic rights like the right to life."""	0.0764104574918747
