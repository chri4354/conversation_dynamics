With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"
"t1_dgawhv0"	"berrieh"	"20"	"The argument with legislation against abortion (\\"being against\\" is too broad a phrase; one can be against something, yet not want to legislate it) being sexist is complicated. It has several components: 1) Despite growing equity, legislators are still predominantly male. This leads to a bunch of men passing legislation that only affects women's bodies. Men controlling what women do with their bodies has some inherent sexism to it, even if sexism isn't the *goal*.2) Additionally, much of the legislation involved seeks to limit other forms of birth control (and funds to provide them freely) that would reduce the need for abortions. Considering that birth control is the primary reason that the feminist revolution was able to happen, this is key. If women cannot control their reproduction, equality is essentially impossible. As far as I know, none of these people have proposed ways to maintain equality (can we research keeping zygotes viable outside the mother? can we secure funding for every woman who is pregantant, give them workplace protections that are absolute, and give everyone free daycare so that bearing children has 0 economic impact? Can we provide free and symptom-free birth control?) while taking abortion away and many have done the opposite. They don't seem to just want to end abortion because they're sad about the zygote or whatever (though that is the line they use) but also to want to actively imprison women as the vehicle for childbirth seeing that as the \\"natural order\\" of things. That's sexism and it's the foundation of sexism, I would argue. I think sexism and gender stereotypes are essentially formed around the biology of human reproduction. If men were the ones who bore children, women would have fought wars and lead industries for centuries. IF both bore children, maybe equality would be natural and not hard won. Who knows? 3) Women are ultimately the only ones affected by such laws at the end of the day, thus it is clearly a woman's issue. At the end of the day, these laws represent discrimination against women on the basis of sex. The fact that this is due to something we haven't yet tackled to change about biology (no one has attempted to alter the biological means of human reproduction sufficiently, really, so we don't know if it could be done) doesn't mean that these laws are not solely leveled against women on the basis of their sex. 4) For the most part, the same people who are advocates of LAWS that are anti-choice (and many people are \\"pro-life\\" without wanting to limit reproductive freedom, actually) are advocating a traditional mindset. They're not interested in outside-the-box solutions to the issue of the zygote, as I said above. They don't care about the impact it would have on women, at best, and sometimes would be happy with women in a more traditional role. To not consider women's rights while restricting them for other reasons is also sexist. I have yet to see an anti-choice law proposed with any provisions that protect women in any way, shape, or form, from the natural sexism of forcing women to bear children when they do not want to do so. 5) And the largest one: At the end of the day, participating in institutional decisions (like laws) that we fundamentally know lead to sexist results = sexism. My personal aversion to anti-choice laws actually has nothing to do with sexism and everything to do with bodily autonomy (male or female, no one should tell you that you must donate a kidney, carry an organism to term that cannot be self-supporting, etc), but I also think such things are more rooted in sexism than you suggest."
"t1_dgb17cb"	"SobanSa"	NA	"Here is the problem, abortion can be viewed as a moral issue. Man and Women can both analyze the morality of a situation even if they themselves will not be in it. To me, Birth Control and childcare is 99% of the time orthogonal to the issue of abortion. Unless the birth control also has the impact of also potentially aborting the child, (hint: most forms of birth control don't) it's irrelevant to the issue of abortion. One can be fully for sex education, childcare, and birth control, while still being against abortion. We can imagine a world where both men and women could give birth. It would not change the arguments for/against abortion. Thus it seems to me that just because we are in a universe where only one gender gives birth, then being against abortion is not inherently sexist."

One can be fully for sex education, childcare, and birth control, while still being against abortion.Well, bodily autonomy is a moral issue as well, so, of course, it's a moral issue. I'm not sure your point there. I believe being anti-choice is extremely immoral, personally, so I understand how it's a moral issue. Not sure that's really the scope of this CMV. The point I am making is that the outcomes are anti-feminist and sexist, thus the position is anti-feminist and sexist. The use of \\"orthogonal\\" in that sentence makes no sense to me. As to laws against abortion, I'm speaking as one analyzing laws. A law could be written that wasn't sexist and was anti-choice in theory (it would have to provide mitigation for the sexist repercussions of anti-choice legislation, but one has never been and I doubt one ever would be because the basis of being anti-choice in practicality is almost always anti-feminist as well). The most logical choice if you feel a moral imperative for a zygote would be to pursue science that allows them to gestate without a human being needed as an incubator. Yet I am willing to bet that in the majority of cases, anti-choice people are the last people who would support such research being federally funded. ;We can imagine a world where both men and women could give birth. It would not change the arguments for/against abortion. It would absolutely change the context of the discussion and I believe it would change the arguments as well, actually."

Pro-abortion anti-contraceptives is a possible combination. Perhaps not likely, but possible.Absolutely. That was only one of my subpoints and based on existing legislation attempts. For instance, someone who supports/proposes legislation that far expands birth control availability and research into more equitable means of BC (i.e. cost-free and symptom-free for women, as well as 100%) as a means to reduce and eventually ban abortion would probably not be sexist, but this is not the means in which most people want to ban abortion. Most legislation is anti-women and anti-sex, and anyone supporting anti-choice legislation is supporting that, whether it's their goal/intent or not. ;I agree, however we currently live in a world without one and so that's the situation we have to deal with.

That problem remains irrespective of who carries the children.The last sentence holds no meaning because \\"who carries the children\\" is not changeable at the moment. It's very easy to say \\"ifs\\" that will never be true. There are inherently sexist outcomes to every anti-choice position (legislatively) that can currently exist, therefore being legislatively anti-choice is sexist. Being morally opposed to abortion personally is obviously a different issue. But being FORCED to potentially be a human incubator (whose body and career could also be ruined by that forced event) OR deny your sexuality as a human (the 2 options women are left with, with our current level of science) being because of your gender is an inherently a sexist outcome. And ultimately, supporting a sexist outcome is sexist and thus makes you sexist, whether that is the primary intent or not."
