Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dr4e95n	akuzena		Its not for you to decide if its moral. Pro choice means youre leaving the decision up to the woman who wants the abortion.	0.5003231763839722	0.5003231763839722	0.48337727785110474
2	t1_dr4qppr	Durzio		Okay, but what if this person is a woman who is pregnant? This doesnâ€™t address the question.	0.03712203726172447	0.03712203726172447	0.03706638887524605
3	t1_dr4rsip	akuzena		If OP wants to not have an abortion then cool. The point is that the decision to either have or not have an abortion should always be available. The opinions of others dont matter in the decision of the person who is pregnant. The idea is that the choice to have an abortion must not be restricted from those who want one, and abortion shouldnt be forced on people who dont want one.	0.0006808559410274029	0.06565579771995544	0.11278079450130463
4	t1_dr4rur6	Durzio		I agree with you, I am also pro choice. But this question is about morality, not legality. I was simply pointing out that your original statement did not address this.	0.8952866792678833	0.6335187554359436	0.4462001919746399
5	t1_dr4t80p	akuzena		Oh alritey i thought we were referring to like if abortion should be allowed or not based on morality. Personally i have no stake in this because im a male but heres my opinion anyway. Abortion is alright. If you base your morality on whether or not you cause harm to another living thing, then abortion does not make you a bad person. Souls are not real, fetuses are not alive and they are not aware therefore no pain is caused by the abortion. Furthermore morality is relative and the universe is meaningless but that opens up a whole like philosophical debate rabbit hole that keeps going on forever.	0.9994321465492249	0.8242023587226868	0.3108524978160858
