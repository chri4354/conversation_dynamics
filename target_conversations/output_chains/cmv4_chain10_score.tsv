0	t3_5rb7bq	jessebanjo		"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9972221851348877	0.8530923128128052	0.3434939384460449
1	t1_dd73ylr	3point1415nine	1.0	I disagree with your logic for putting this argument forward. As a pro choice person, I don't believe that a fetus is fully a person yet. If a fetus was a person capable of feeling pain and experiencing emotions the way that a baby is, than i would feel a lot more conflicted about abortions and find them morally difficult to justify in most cases. I feel that this distinction is really important to make and shouldn't be put aside. I can't help but feel that your argument about self defence equates fetuses with persons. For example, laws about self defence don't include defending yourself against a bear, because a bear is not considered a person and it's life is not legally protected in the way that a human's is. I believe that abortion should be legal on the grounds that human beings have the right to bodily atonomy, and a fetus (in the first two trimesters anyways) should not have any rights of it's own yet because it is not a person.	0.08303648978471756	0.45886650681495667	0.468011736869812
2	t1_dd7eap2	jessebanjo		As a neuroscientist, I find it very difficult to draw the line of when an embryo becomes a baby. This argument allows for abortion even if the personhood begins at conception.	0.9980649948120117	0.9980649948120117	0.0018645823001861572
