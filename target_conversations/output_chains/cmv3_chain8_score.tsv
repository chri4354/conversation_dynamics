0	Rockmar1	665	"I'm making this CMV because I've noticed that my views on abortion don't really line up with either of the two main viewpoints on it (although they're much closer to a pro-choice viewpoint than a pro-life one). This isn't so much one specific view as it is a collection of related views regarding abortion.I'll specifically list the things that I believe and the things that I don't believe. I think it's good to address both sides because we live in a world where a simple sentence like \\I support gun rights\\"" has people immediately jumping to conclusions about your views on everything from race relations and gay marriage to economic standpoints and foreign policy. Addressing both sides helps to avoid people reaching incorrect conclusions.Important note: For the purposes of this discussion I am writing this with the assumption in mind that a fetus at any point in development is equivalent to a human life. I **do not** believe this and I will explain my reasons for making this assumption in the \\""Things I don't believe\\"" section.Also, I am from the U.S.A. and I will be writing this with specific regards to the United States. When I say 'government', 'society', etc. I mean the U.S. government or U.S. society.**Things that I believe***View*: Abortions help society.*Reasoning*: There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies. For starters, every human who is born takes up a lot of resources, and produces a lot of pollution. The average American is responsible for roughly 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita)). Essentially, humans are bad for the environment so less humans is a good thing if we consider climate change to be important.Additionally, unwanted babies are more likely to grow up in bad situations (since they were unwanted), and are more likely to become criminals detrimental to society, or if not criminals then people on welfare which is also detrimental to society. Now yes, it is possible that some aborted baby would have grown up to be the next Einstein. But since it is more likely that they will end up being detrimental to society, I see no reason why we should assume that the less likely of two outcomes will happen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Women of any age, citizenship status, etc. should be able to get an abortion from any abortion clinic for free, no questions asked.*Reasoning*: In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 ([source](https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2014/06/much-abortion-cost-draft-theresas/)). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. If you oppose a doctor simply informing their patient of the facts, then you oppose spreading knowledge and have no place in any sort of philosophical discussion. If you still do not like the fact that the woman may be more likely to choose abortion when they are more aware of the facts, then maybe you should rethink your position on the matter because when people gain knowledge on the subject they become more likely to disagree with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.*Reasoning*: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.Also not that this is fundamentally different from things such as breastfeeding or a mother simply providing food for her child. Breast milk serves no purpose to the mother, and the nutrients stored in food do not belong to anyone until they consume that food. In this way, a fetus in the womb truly does steal nutrients from the mother. A baby does not steal nutrients from the mother, but rather uses nutrients that were either useless to the mother (breastmilk), or provided by the mother as a gift and therefore never the mother's in the first place.----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.*Reasoning*: This point will probably cause the most controversy. Many people will disagree with this because late in the pregnancy, the fetus would be able to survive on its own if it were surgically removed from the woman in the proper manner. However, I believe that just because it would be able to survive on its own does not change the fact that it is still essentially a parasite and the woman still deserves the right to remove that parasite from her body. The fetus, while in the womb, is still feeding off the nutrients of the mother (regardless of whether or not it could survive outside the womb), and therere should be treated as a parasite.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Things that I do not believe***View*: Women should be forced to have abortions.*Reasoning*: This one is obvious but it must be stated, I do not believe that any woman, for any reason, should EVER be forced into having an abortion. Encouraging them is fine, informing them is fine, forcing them is not.--------------------------------------*View*: A fetus's life is equivalent to a human life*Reasoning*: As I mentioned earlier, I want this discussion to be had with the assumption in mind that fetus's are equivalent to human lives. However, I do not believe this is true. The reason I wish for this to be the assumption is that pro-lifers tend to get hung up on this which I know will lead to a meaningless discussion because I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were **uneqivocally proven** that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to \\""I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way.\\""----------------------------------*View*: All killing is bad*Reasoning*: There are many forms of killing that are generally considered acceptable. Soldiers kill other soldiers in wartime, people are allowed to kill in self-defense, and criminals are executed due to their crimes. All of these are perfectly legal forms of killing, and though some are controversial most would agree that at least one of the three is justified. I believe that abortion is another one of these types of killing. This is also why I don't care whether the fetus is a human or not - I view it as a legally and morally justified form of killing.While I am interested in having my view changed, I am also interested in simply having a discussion on the topic.

7	Matapatapa	6	"Also, you cannot call it a parasite when there is specific apparatus to keep it alive and healthy, and create it.

8	Rockmar1	1	&gt; Also, you cannot call it a parasite when there is specific apparatus to keep it alive and healthy, and create it. Ovaries, eggs, the entire repurductive system etc. Can we call poison poison even though there's a system (liver) designed to deal with it? It can still fail and you'll end up dead, just like reproduction. The fact that systems are in place to help deal with a parasite doesn't hold up as much when there's a relatively high risk of dying from pregnancy.	0.38857221603393555
9	Matapatapa	1	"You're going too far off on a tangent. With the liver example \\poison\\"" does not exactly have to be\\""poison\\"". Hell anything is poison in the right amount of your liver failed. Would you say a glass of water or milk is poison ? No; just because it's poisonous to one human does not mean it poisonous to the vast majority. You can't straight up compare and equate a fetus to a parasite; the only way is through excessive self-rationalisaion. If you compare them on one a really simple and singular level I can see where it comes from however.What you are doing is thinking=If Parasite=takes resources and harms host and fetus does same...Fetus \\""MUST\\"" be parasite! You might as well be saying \\""well if my drinking glass is made of glass and my glasses are made of glass they \\""MUST\\"" be the same\\""( Forgive me for the terrible examples/explanation ) There are a few more differences then that. A parasite walks along and attaches itself to the host. A fetus everything is almost there in the body anyway, it's better to consider it a sort of tumor. After seperation ; what host in other parasitr-host examples in nature retains ( or tends to retain ) extreme fervor in the caretaking of a child? This does not happen with any other sort of parasite-host relationship at all. I mean, if something has been leeching off you and hurting you ( AKA a parasite ) , why doesn't every animal/human dropkick and kill the offending thing as soon as it's able? Also, if it is indeed a parasite, why do female animals specifically seek out children when they are of a certain age? I mean I wouldn't specifically seek out mosquitoes to be bit by. Condensed into one statement; I think your fetus=parasite equation is a result of hyper-rationalisaion , and the fetus has its own class entirely."""	0.9939213991165161
10	Rockmar1	1	Ok, this is a good point. I agree with you and you've done a good job pointing out the differences between a fetus and a parasite. And I like your idea that it's better to consider it some sort of a tumor. From now on, I think that's a better analogy to use.That doesn't exactly change my core view because a tumor is hardly better than a parasite, but it's something that I hadn't considered before and it does modify my original position a bit. I suppose that deseves a delta. ∆	0.5667494535446167
11	Matapatapa	1	But you still have not addressed after birth care. Why would you take care of a tumor after it's gone? You can't consider something a tumor or a parasite if it's taken extreme care of afterwards.You're going to have to declare a fetus as a seperate class at some point.	0.35135796666145325
