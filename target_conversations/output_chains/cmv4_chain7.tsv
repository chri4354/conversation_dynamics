Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\"chooses\\" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."

The murderers, thieves, drunk drivers, etc can't help it. They were forced into that situation by their circumstances."
"t1_dd5w7y6"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"sure, it just means that criminals need a penal system that can either reform their behavior or separate them from vulnerable members of society. Doesn't change society's need to protect people.This logic certainly gets rid of most degrees of moral accountability, replacing it with utilitarian approaches to protect people etc."
