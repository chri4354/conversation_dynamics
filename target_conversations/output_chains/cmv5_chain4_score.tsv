0	t3_5ri7y5	awolz	2.0	First, a clarification: I am undecided as to whether abortion is morally right or wrong. I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

2	t1_dd7h70i	awolz	2.0	I hadn't hugely considered the possible extent of psychiatric damage, so ∆. If you consider an abortion equal to infanticide, though, the amount of damage an abortion will do is still significantly more than the psychological damage of the mother if she completed her pregnancy. I agree that if the psychological damage is going to pose a real risk to the life of the mother - i.e. her likelihood of suicide is significantly higher - then you can justify abortion in the same way you can justify an abortion that will more directly save the mother's life.	0.0183001309633255	0.2586207389831543	0.4269201457500458
3	t1_dd7ggmr	Happy_Laugh_Guy	2.0	OP, I can see from your reply that you're open to considering abortion moral if the mother's life is at stake. If you see physical danger as grounds for terminating a pregnancy, why do you not make a similar allowance for psychological danger. It's not a secret that being raped is harmful to the mental state of individuals. I don't think you can rationally argue, either, that carrying a pregnancy to term that was the result of rape won't have even greater or at least significant psychological implications as well. For real dude. Girl X gets raped and then has to give birth? That would seriously mess somebody up. It can take years of counseling to bounce back from being raped. Imagine how much more damage is done if they have to keep the baby dude.	0.7115779519081116	0.5563037395477295	0.4606313109397888
