"Sensei2006"	"7"	"At what point in the development cycle do you believe a fetus becomes entitled to human rights? At the moment of conception, or some point later in the process?"
"Reason_is_Key"	"1"	"I currently view conception as being the moment that a human is created"
"VortexMagus"	"10"	"One of the reasons that many people (including me) do not share this view with you is that in the process of pregnancy, there are many things that can stop a zygote (the united cell of a sperm and an egg) from maturing. Obstetricians estimate that miscarriage (medical term: spontaneous abortion) happens in [approximately 50% of pregnancies](http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/pregnancy-miscarriage), almost always in the first trimester, usually without the woman even having knowledge that she was pregnant.If we assume that abortion is the killing of a baby, then we must also assume that miscarriage is the death of a baby. It would be inconsistent to claim that abortion is murder without the issue of miscarriage being involuntary manslaughter or death by negligence."
"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	"2"	"It wouldn't really be death by negligence. Only to a certain extent does a woman have the ability to control her body.In addition, those who are pro life believe that causing a person's death unintentionally and by complete accident is not morally wrong. It's also not really enforceable or efficient to investigate all miscarriages either.To neglect is in the spectrum of not caring enough to look after something rather than something in the lines of a complete accident."
"VortexMagus"	"2"	"&gt;Only to a certain extent does a woman have the ability to control her body.But there are a large number of things you can do to avoid miscarriage, or minimize the trouble. You could see a fertility doctor, take fertility drugs, reduce stress, not consume recreational drugs or alcohol, etc. If a woman doesn't do these things, she is greatly increasing the risk of miscarriage and thus, dead babies. Just as you wish to render the number of dead babies from abortion to nearly zero by making it illegal to abort them, we could reduce the number of dead babies from miscarriage to nearly zero by making it illegal for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, we could simply have all our babies birthed from test tubes and have a nearly zero rate of miscarriage. Easy, efficient, simple, no more dead babies. Further bonus that no more women who are harmed or ravaged by pregnancy, which is a very taxing and difficult process!---Or you could just concede that a microscopic cell inside a woman may or may not see fruition as an actual living person, and is not entitled to all the rights and responsibilities thereof, at which point all of this debate becomes moot. The real key to the abortion debate is where we define life to start, and I think any medical professional who has really studied the science and process of pregnancy will know that it doesn't start with the sperm and the egg uniting - there's too many factors involved that make this definition super shaky and inconsistent. Zygotes die all the time for any number of reasons (abortion being only a very tiny percentage of them)."
"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	"2"	"All actions have risks of killing other people either way though, would that mean that everyone should just stay indoors at all times and never drive cars? That's quite absurd. It would be great to keep track of all those things like how irresponsible it is to drink while pregnant, etc, but no one would be able to enforce it (like cheating on your spouse).I would have to argue that the debate on where personhood begins would be is kind of moot. You can refer to Sorites paradoxes. For example, if were to say that moment of personhood or life begins at 23 weeks, would that mean that a 22 week, 6 days, 23 hour old fetus wouldn't have the right to life? Seems kind of arbitrary."
"VortexMagus"	"1"	"&gt;For example, if were to say that moment of personhood or life begins at 23 weeks, would that mean that a 22 week, 6 days, 23 hour old fetus wouldn't have the right to life? Seems kind of arbitrary.Exactly. Meanwhile, you suggest that personhood begins right when the sperm hits the egg, a moment thats impossible to measure, that happens many times without anybody even knowing about it, and which may die without anybody even knowing about it. Seems even more arbitrary than 23 weeks in to me - at least 23 weeks in we can see the baby's organs develop and we know its probably not going to die."
"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	"2"	"The moment of conception may be impossible to measure. However, it basically would mean that the fetus would essentially be a person in all steps of development after conception, which would not require complex arbitrary rules that would have to essentially break down to compare how many cells or type of cells the fetus is lacking.Yes, the fetus could die due to unfortunate circumstances, but since those unintentional deaths couldn't really been soundly prevented, it would be inculpable."
"VortexMagus"	"1"	"&gt;Yes, the fetus could die due to unfortunate circumstances, but since those unintentional deaths couldn't really been soundly prevented, it would be inculpable.They *could* have been prevented, though. There are many ways to reduce or mitigate the effects of miscarriage entirely. For example, we could ban all women from drinking alcohol, doing recreational drugs, force them all to go to a fertility doctor, reduce their stress levels, or simply just ban pregnancy entirely and have all our babies out of test tubes. Miscarriage solved, easy as pie."
"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	"1"	"Even though that those might reduce the chance of miscarriage, miscarriage can still happen due to random chance. We still don't fully know why miscarriages happen either, so I wouldn't say that it is just solved just like that."
