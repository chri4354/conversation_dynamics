0	t3_64szba	curiouscat145		I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.9912165999412537	0.7279090285301208	0.3905256390571594

2	t1_dg4t8m5	neofederalist	7.0	"&gt; I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. I don't understand this statement within the context of the rest of your position. If it's legal, it's going to be used as birth control in some cases. Saying it \\shouldn't be used as birth control\\"" seems to imply there should be some restriction on the procedure other than how far along the pregnancy is (which opens up logistical issues). In fact, the people who are irresponsible and unable to make good parents seem the most likely not to properly use birth control properly anyway, making this point a non-negligible percentage of all abortions being done. If you aren't taking a strong moral position against it in general, I don't see how using it for birth control is intrinsically worse than using it for other reasons."""	0.11075162142515182	0.4246959686279297	0.4679180681705475
