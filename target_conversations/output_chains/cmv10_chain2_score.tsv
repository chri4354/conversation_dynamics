0	t3_69us5b	buzzardsgutsman		"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."""	0.9958481788635254	0.742600679397583	0.3838673532009125
1	t1_dh9izax	Torin_2	1.0	The difference is that once they decide to have the child, they have taken on the obligation to care for the child once it comes into the world.

3	t1_dh9k5yf	z3r0shade	46.0	&gt; The Virgin Mary is the only unintentional pregnancy I can think of off handIf the condom breaks and you get pregnant, is that not an unintended pregnancy? This flippant comment, however much in jest it was, is part of the problem. Just because you choose to engage in an action with a known risk of a negative outcome doesn't mean you consent that outcome.A good example is driving. Everyone knows that choosing to drive carries a risk of being in an accident. Yet if someone is hit by a drunk driver we don't tell them that it is their own fault for choosing to drive despite the risks. We don't tell them that they aren't allowed to seek medical care to alleviate the problems or have their car fixed because they should have known better and accepted That they might get into an accident. No, the person who hit them is forced to pay for the damage because we acknowledge that choosing to drive is not consent to be hit by another car.	0.570517897605896	0.5078697800636292	0.40032991766929626
