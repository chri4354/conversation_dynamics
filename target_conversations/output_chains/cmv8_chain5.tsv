The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\"Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\"But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

"t1_dj69xtt"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"I'm not really concerned with what makes my viewpoint more popular. I'm simply saying that the line between \\"a cluster of cells\\" and \\"a person\\" is arbitrary and ill-defined. I'm still just a cluster of cells, but I'm a cluster of cells with a bank account who's registered to vote."
"t1_dj6bf8s"	"paul_aka_paul"	"2"	"&gt;I'm simply saying that the line between \\"a cluster of cells\\" and \\"a person\\" is arbitrary and ill-defined.But you suggest conception as the logical line in the sand. That is also arbitrary and ill-defined. I fail to see how conceding the underlying disagreement by granting the anti-abortion their arbitrary definition of life is anything but surrender. You want to argue that it is murder but that murder is OK. Do you think you'll win hearts and minds with your speed limit comparison? The 55 mph limit didn't end fatal accidents. Do we support death by just spending tax dollars on roads? Of course not. But that is a form of the argument you are trying to make. Cars, junk food, alcohol, exposure to the sun - do all of these activities need to be banned to prove we care about life?"
"t1_dj7tqi8"	"paul_aka_paul"	"2"	"That is the point. There isn't a clear objective line where a heap or conception arises from non-heapness or non-conception. They are arbitrary by nature."
"t1_dj69m2v"	"empurrfekt"	"9"	"So your reconciliation is to concede one point (that is insignificant to your side) so that get your way?People who are pro-life aren't going to be okay with abortion because they get an ego boost that they were right about it ending a life. If anything, that concession should embolden them, removing the doubt that they aren't pushing to protect life but just a cluster of cells."
"t1_dj6u9x3"	"Nahasapemapetila"	NA	"You have to admit it's much less arbitrary than pretty much any other point you could think of, aside from birth itself, because there is no way you could chose an earlier point. I'm not sure that solves anything but it's a decent start."
"t1_dj812m3"	"paul_aka_paul"	"2"	"&gt;It's not arbitrary though to me it's a heap when it looks like a heap/pile basically when it's enough matter to form an amorphous structure And if you take away one grain, can you tell the difference? Do you relabel it?"
"t1_dj73xyu"	"paul_aka_paul"	"2"	"Conception isn't a point. It is a process. It is the sorites paradox. Start with a heap of sand and remove one grain. Is it still a heap? If so, repeat the process. Eventually you are left with a single grain. If the single grain isn't a heap, where was the line?"
