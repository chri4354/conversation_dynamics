"Daniel_A_Johnson"	"I'm pro-choice, but I also think that the traditional talking points on both sides completely ignore those on the other side. The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\"Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\"But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

"ralph-j"	"215"	"&gt; The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.How is conception not just another one out of many arbitrary points various parties have proposed?I'd agree that at conception, the clump of cells can be shown to be *alive* and *of human origin*, but that does not make them \\"a human life\\", \\"a person\\", or anything like that. The latter two are loaded terms and depend on how we define what a human life is in the first place, and that is necessarily arbitrary.I agree with the rest of your post, and I believe that bodily integrity should be decisive, not personhood or humanness or any such wishy-washy term."
"Daniel_A_Johnson"	"35"	"&gt; bodily integrity should be decisiveIsn't it troubling to make an ethical distinction that hinges on technological advancement? What makes a 24-week fetus conceived in 2017 more deserving of human rights than one conceived in 1950?For that matter, if the technology were ever developed to support a fetus from 2 weeks after conception, should the law change?"
"z3r0shade"	"31"	"&gt; Isn't it troubling to make an ethical distinction that hinges on technological advancement?Not at all, we do it all the time. As technology changes we constantly have to reevaluate ethical frameworks and decisions as technology changes how people interact with the world around them and others. ; What makes a 24-week fetus conceived in 2017 more deserving of human rights than one conceived in 1950?Nothing, and no one is claiming otherwise. The argument is that the woman has a right to remove the fetus from her body, by lethal force if necessary. But if there exists an alternative that is accessible and will not kill the fetus, that must be done instead.; For that matter, if the technology were ever developed to support a fetus from 2 weeks after conception, should the law change?Provided the technology was widely accessible and affordable and we answered the questions of who pays for its care and upbringing (likely the state), I'd be fine with abortions that don't use this supposed technology being outlawed"
"Axiomatic88"	"6"	"This is a really interesting argument. If we could perform an \\"abortion\\" on a fetus at 2 weeks, but put it into a technologically driven state that can still see it mature to a baby, should abortion be outlawed? It does come down to accessibility and affordability of the alternative, in this case. Which loops back to OCs original argument that preservation of human life isn't the driving force of the law, and other factors (like socio-economic group) need to be taken into consideration in the application of the law. Some groups would be able to afford this tech, some won't. Should it be illegal for the former to have abortions, but not the latter, in this scenario?"
"Dr_Tonyjnel"	"1"	"In a society where embryos can be safely removed after two weeks and brought to term and there is a decent childcare system in place, of course abortion should be illegal. I think it would be hard to find anyone who disagrees with that."
"Dupree878"	"3"	"Me. I disagree. Unless you're talking about no cost removal and implantation in that artificial womb. Abortion is already too expensive."
"Dr_Tonyjnel"	"2"	"Yea the argument only makes sense if it's affordable."
"FoxForce5Iron"	"1"	"How about a situation where the mother is opposed to passing on her genes?"
"Dr_Tonyjnel"	"1"	"There's probably room for debate here but in general I don't think I'd consider that a good enough reason. If the embryo is predisposed to a pretty significant disorder, abortion should be an option, but not just because the parents don't want their genes out there."
"FoxForce5Iron"	"2"	"&gt; If the embryo is predisposed to a pretty significant disorder, abortion should be an option, but not just because the parents don't want their genes out there. So you think people shouldn't get to decide whether or not their genes are passed on? That's an incredibly strong stance. To clarify: Are saying that no one has a right to determine what happens to their own genetic material, or are you saying that once a fetus is conceived, it's too late to make that kind of decision?If it's the latter, is it morally justifiable for the parents to give that child up without explaining in detail to any adoptive parents the potential issues that could arise? I'm talking about everything from a severe underbite (the type requiring years of corrective orthodontics) to schizophrenia to Huntington's disease."
"Dr_Tonyjnel"	"0"	"I think predisposition to disorders is sufficient reason for abortion. I don't think \\"not wanting your genes passed on\\" is not a sufficient reason."
"FoxForce5Iron"	"0"	"&gt;I think predisposition to disorders is sufficient reason for abortion. I don't think \\"not wanting your genes passed on\\" is not a sufficient reason. Do you understand how these two sentences contradict eachother? Hell, being predisposed to colds could be considered a disorder. Who are you to judge what reason is sufficient enough to not want your genes passed on?I honestly think you've never considered this issue. If so, congratulations. You've lived a sheltered, precious life."
"Dr_Tonyjnel"	"2"	"Wow that super rude and condescending comment came out of nowhere. I thought we were having pretty nice discussion."
