Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dr3r5z7	Madplato	55.0	&gt; 1) There is plenty of reason to suggest that a zygote/fetus is not a person, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't a human being.Maybe, but that's hardly the end of all considerations. Human beings don't have a right to occupy another's body. If they end up doing so, it should be with that person's consent *only*. So it should be up to the woman, always, whether the fetus stays or goes. 2) Even among pro-choice advocates, most probably would agree that it is immoral to kill human beingsA bit too general. Coming from point 1, I can swear that most would agree it's justified to kill to protect one's bodily integrity. You don't even need to go that far, in fact. The reasoning relies less on the killing and more on the removing. If there was a way to remove fetuses safely from mothers as soon as they want them gone, I'm pretty sure support for abortion would dwindle.	0.9576785564422607	0.732554018497467	0.3604077100753784

10	t1_dr4w8om	Fionn_Mac_Cumhaill		Doesn't include body fluid? I'm sure you've heard of breastfeeding. It's considered murder to starve your child to death by refusing them your breastmilk. And reasonably so, as this is parental obligation.It actually doesn't have little bearing, much in the same way my autonomy doesn't have any bearing on whether I may loosen my hand when you're dangling off a cliff. To lossen is to attack you natural rights. Autonomy *always* ends when your rights infringe on someone else's. It's honestly only with abortion that people ignore that. (I feel like you didn't notice me saying stating something as the object of a premise isn't objectification.) I fully reject the idea that autonomy supersedes natural rights as I've never seen someone apply that consistently, due mainly to it being palatably unethical to everyone when differently applied.Why does them sharing from birth matter? Are natural rights a first come first served deal? No one earns superior rights (ridiculous in itself) by being privileged by location in time. And you didn't engage with the senario anyway. What if they couldn't be separated? Whatever it is that you think merits personhood, heartbeat, nervous system, brain, etc. imagine that one individual developed that sooner that the other.No point playing that card when I can use it right back.Let's break that down. The painting situation:1) You have a right to create.2) I have a right to my body.3) One right may not abolish another.Therefore: You have no right to use my body to paint. Good. Next one:1) A woman has the right to her body.2) A child has a right to their body.3) One right may not abolish the other.Therefore: A woman has no right to abolish the body of the child.

You have no obligation to hold unto me, *especially* if doing so puts you in harms way. I certainly have no right to feel *entitled* that you'll do so.

It's only with abortion that people insist that anyone has a right to reside inside someone else against their wish.

14	t1_dr552pp	Fionn_Mac_Cumhaill		Communities that have no access to alternatives. Everyone was a slave till wet nurses came about. What?That's fair. I could rephrase it to something more specific but I don't feel I have to for you to understand the situation I'm describing. You're mixing up positive and negative rights. A positive right is the obligation on others to certain duties. A negative right is the requirement for others to abstain from certain actions. Organ donation is positive, but killing is negative. It cannnot be coherently argued that taking the life of the unborn is not a violation of their negative right to life. That's why people have to somehow declare they don't possess that right in the first place. Those arguments are far more understandable than this psudo-conflict.What comes before the result is morally relevant. It's not at all honest nor reasonable to compare assault to pregnancy. It may be better to compare to owning land and someone trespasses (and can't leave through no fault of their own). You were there first, as you seem to think is important, and they have entered the object of your rights without your consent. You may kill them through your logic. Whereas I'm saying these rights to property/body and life are not to be put against one another and you may not kill them.The object of my rights is what I said. What you've said here is counter to the usual understanding of rights and law as an absolute statement. Plenty of justifiable exceptions.I dont think I've anymore new arguments to put forth and I'm afraid of talking circles.
