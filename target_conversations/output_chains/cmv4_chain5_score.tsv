0	t3_5rb7bq	jessebanjo		"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9972221851348877	0.8530923128128052	0.3434939384460449
1	t1_dd5wq8l	ralph-j	24.0	I agree that abortion should be a legal choice, but I think that this is better defended by the bodily integrity argument: no one has the right to force women to stay pregnant against their will. This also works regardless of when the fetus gets human rights, since someone's human rights cannot extend to the use of someone else's body against their will. Saying that you consider it equivalent to rape is not going to convince many people. Referring to sexual consent might be useful as a backup argument in some cases, e.g. one could argue that both staying pregnant and sexual activity require continuous consent.	0.49623262882232666	0.497883141040802	0.49646466970443726

3	t1_dd61t9c	ralph-j	27.0	Yes, I'm not saying that it's a weak argument in a logical/rational sense. I'm just saying that you'll have a much harder time using it to convince others.	0.11252128332853317	0.11252128332853317	0.10758893191814423
