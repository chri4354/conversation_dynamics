With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"

"t1_dgc7c2l"	"nickburgess"	NA	"I think women can be sexist against women. Or at least they can hold inherently sexist views. There are women out there who believe it is the duty of a woman to be in the home cleaning and cooking and women should not be out working. Just because they are a woman does not mean they aren't sexist against women. There are black people that hate other black people because they are black. This is a racist view. Just because they are black doesn't mean they can't be racist against other black people."
