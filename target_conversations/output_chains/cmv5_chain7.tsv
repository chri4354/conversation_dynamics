"awolz"	"First, a clarification: I am undecided as to whether abortion is morally right or wrong. I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

"Amablue"	"36"	"Consider the following two scenarios:1. A driver maliciously runs over someone they hate, an ex perhaps, killing them. 2. A driver loses control of their car striking a pedestrian, killing them. Both of these situations in the abstract are very similar. A person behind the wheel of a car kills a person. However, that does not mean we treat these cases the same when they go to court. While the first driver will almost certainly go to jail, the second one may not. Despite being in essentially the same action, we deprive one person of their freedom and the other one we do not. The reason is obvious: The first driver made a conscious choice to do something, and is therefore must be held responsible for their choice. The second person did not decide to kill a person. Perhaps they were trying to swerve to miss something else, or the pedestrian was wearing black and jaywalking in the middle of the night, or the driver suffered a sudden seizure - there are all kinds of situations where the driver may have done little or nothing wrong. If this is the case, they are a victim of circumstance, and so we don't hold them accountable for the situation they were a part of. Many people believe that fetuses are alive, and that by having sex you are waiving your right to not be pregnant. To them, when you choose to take a risky action it's not permissible to commit murder to get out of dealing with the consequences of that action. However, if you are raped, that's not a situation you chose to be in. You never waived your right to your body. You didn't choose this situation, so your freedom isn't deprived. Yes, a life is still ended, but it wasn't your responsibility to give birth to that child in the first place. Note that I don't agree with that view, but if you accept the premises I gave then the logic makes sense."
"hayhen14"	"1"	"No. First of all, whether a fetus is alive or is a human being is completely irrelevent. All that matter is whether it possesses moral properties: has the ability to suffer/have pleasure, realize its own autonomy. All other factors are not relevent in moral questions. A tree is alive, a scab has human cells, my sperm have chromosomes. Even the point at which a sperm meets an egg, so what? Why does a zygote have moral entitlements while a squirrel, a being able to feel pain the same as any other being and realize and act on its own autonomy does not? Its idiotic. Evaluate whether a fetus can feel pain or realize its will, not whether its \\"alive\\". Second, victim of circumstance is fallicious. If I walk into an abandoned warehouse and find someone tied up and on the verge of death, I should call for help. If I run away, that is my fault. No one gets a get out of jail free card for moral actions when put into a \\"circumstance.\\" Besides, what defines a circumstance? Isn't every single moral action regarding a circumstance. For example, if I go into a gas station and buy a chocolate bar for myself, that money could have given a meal to someone on the verge of death. That is a circumstance I was in, in that there was a gas station and suffeirng/pleasure in the balance. What determines whether I am free from my actions in a circumstance? If I don't like it? SillyRegardless, your example for relating to women getting raped doesn't work because you don't refute the fact that a fetus's life is worth more than a woman's autonomy (given you accept a zygote on equal moral property to a human). Life is the greaterst of all moral properties, over liberty. The only part of your argument that works in the victim of circumstance, which once examined doesn't work."
"Amablue"	"2"	"You're right that 'alive' was the wrong word to use. I should have said something about it achieving personhood - although even then that's a somewhat nebulous criteria since people can't agree on what gives human life value.; If I walk into an abandoned warehouse and find someone tied up and on the verge of death, I should call for help. If I run away, that is my fault. No one gets a get out of jail free card for moral actions when put into a \\"circumstance.\\"I literally just gave an example where the circumstance mattered. Circumstances matter immensely. If someone is stolen from it's not your duty to reimburse them. Not unless, of course, you were the thief. We don't expect Bill Gates to come in and foot the bill because he can. ; Life is the greaterst of all moral properties, over liberty.I strongly disagree with this. This leads to a number of absurd conclusions. This makes it moral to kill people to harvest their organs. This makes it immoral to take any kind of risk with your children, like bringing them out to go swimming."
