0	t3_5rb7bq	jessebanjo		"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9972221851348877	0.8530923128128052	0.3434939384460449
1	t1_dd607q4	phoenixrawr	7.0	"The problem with your equivocation is that you're trying to justify violent self defense with a double meaning - \\being inside you\\"" (sexual penetration) without consent is rape, and violent rape warrants violent self defense, therefore being inside you (pregnancy) also warrants violent self defense. The difference is that rape and sexual assault are potentially violent crimes that can threaten your safety and pregnancy is a natural life process for the fetus that rarely ever poses a serious threat to the mother.You can't justify lethal self defense because \\""it's possible they might be a risk eventually.\\"" You can't go to a KKK rally, shoot the place up, and claim that it was self defense because you're black and they might have come to lynch you at some point unless you dealt with them now. The vast majority of pregnancies are safe and healthy so taking violent action against a fetus without a medical opinion confirming that this particular pregnancy is dangerous to carry to term would not be a case of justified self defense."""	0.8462973237037659	0.8311750292778015	0.1927868127822876

Most pregnancies don't incur any such risk so a self defense argument for abortion wouldn't hold up to scrutiny."""	0.0023212337400764227	0.4000144600868225	0.4888252913951874
3	t1_dd5zp7m	jessebanjo		The importance of my equivocation is that in order to get the person out of you it may be necessary to use violent self defense. In regards to risk of loss of life, It's important to recognize that it isn't always obvious early in the pregnancy how dangerous the pregnancy is. Perfectly healthy women in normal pregnancies can experience life threatening complications, so the risk of death cannot be ignored.	0.9964233040809631	0.9815366864204407	0.02285931631922722
4	t1_dd65ohk	jessebanjo		Rape is rarely a lethal assault, but it does cause a lot of pain and misery. An unwanted pregnancy can cause just as much pain and misery, so I think the comparison stands.In response to your second point about the kkk rally, i don't think that is a fair comparisson because the physical burden of pregnancy is actual and ongoing, unlike the kkk rally which merely suggests future danger	0.9996576309204102	0.9997522234916687	0.00016463547945022583
