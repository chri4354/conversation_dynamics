Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9940117001533508
1	aRabidGerbil	3	Defending yourself against a rapist is considered acceptable because the rapist is placing you in bodily danger, being pregnant does not place you in any danger (barring complications) so the analogy your presenting is false	0.9985290765762329
2	jessebanjo	2	a pregnancy is often extremely taxing on the mother's health and emotional state. delivery of a child is extremely painful and frequently dangerous. Rape is also infrequently deadly, but very painful and emotionally taxing so the comparison stands. The bodily harm of an unwanted pregnancy and delivery of a child is comparable to the trauma of being raped.	0.23647743463516235
3	aRabidGerbil	6	Self defense is generally only considered appropriate when the force of a the defense is reasonably proportionate to the force of the attack that is why you will still go to jail if you shoot someone for pushing you, or shouting harassments at you.in the case of abortion you are killing a person in retaliation for slight physical discomfort	0.4968581199645996
4	jessebanjo	2	This is probably the best response I've heard so far and comes close to CMV. I am hesitant to accept your argument because the degree of physical discomfort, and cost of a pregnancy is really hard to estimate. A pregnancy can be very painful and unpleasant and complications can be life threatening. For this reason, I still believe the suffering of an unwanted pregnancy may be enough to justify the killing.	0.9884001016616821
5	aRabidGerbil	2	"Life threatening completions are a very different scenario, even the Catholic Church is okay with an abortion to save a mother's life.You think that the discomfort is worth killing the fetus would you also support a court defendant's statement \\I had to murder him your honor, if I hadn't I might have experienced 3-9 months of aches and nausea\\""?"""	0.5239477157592773
6	sophistry13	2	Out of interest what would you think about mental anguish to the point where the mother would commit suicide due to the pregnancy? Is it permissible then? If so, how do you bar all women from just lying about that and claiming they are mentally unstable? I think in my country at least almost all abortions are put down as impacting the mental health of the mother. Just because simply not wanting the child and being forced to go through with it against their will is causing mental anguish. It'd be tricky to try to prove that one person was lying about wanting to commit suicide in that situation though.	0.9792717099189758
7	aRabidGerbil	2	Mental anguish that pushes a mother to suicide is definitely something I'd call a life threatening complication.That being said I would say that the first step would be therapy not abortion, if a trained therapist believes that the mother's life is in danger then that's very different than just a claim from the mother	0.9993914365768433
8	sophistry13	2	I agree with you. That's a really good point. I agree that all people who consider abortion should have access to counselling and psychiatric help. At least here in the UK and I'm guessing the US too, mental health services are massively underfunded so that help often falls to charities rather than the free health service here.	0.9718759059906006
9	aRabidGerbil	1	"While mental health should be better funded that doesn't effect the consideration of self defense.If some said \\I was being bullied to the point of committing suicide so I killed the bully\\"" that doesn't absolve them of the killing it just points the need for mental healthcare"""	0.009169789962470531
10	jessebanjo	2	this is very good point. Kids who are bullied everyday and eventually snap back with lethal violence are usually prosecuted to the extreme extent of the law. In the sense that the mental anguish associated with unwanted pregnancy is similar to bullying, I can see how resorting to lethal violence is unjustified. However, a major difference here is that there are multiple ways to stop bullying, including parent/teacher interventions or changing school systems. The only possible ways to end the mental anguish of pregnancy is an abortion or extensive counseling to the point of changing the mother's mind about what they want to do. Since extensive therapy is a theoretical alternative to the abortion, I suppose that it should be attempted first. However, I think that there are a lot of messy details about how far therapy can go in changing the mind of the mother before it goes too far. therefore I still think that the use of lethal force as the only possible method to end the suffering of the mother is justified	0.9420650601387024
