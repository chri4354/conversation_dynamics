With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"
"t1_dgavjwo"	"jakefromstatefarm10"	NA	"You're coming out against a basic human right for a woman to control HER body. That is sexist."
"t1_dgaybw5"	"moonflower"	"51"	"Not necessarily - if men could also get pregnant, the anti-abortionists could also be against men having abortions. It's not their fault that only women can get pregnant."
"t1_dgb0if7"	"berrieh"	"20"	"But men cannot get pregnant, so that is a moot point."
"t1_dgb31az"	"moonflower"	"51"	"No, it's not moot, because it shows that being against the killing of foetuses is not inherently sexist."
"t1_dgb5om8"	"berrieh"	"20"	"It does not. It shows that biology makes this a concern irrelevant to men, but that doesn't stop it from being inherently sexist."
"t1_dgba7qe"	"moonflower"	"51"	"No, it's not *inherently* sexist - if modern medical technology enabled a man to grow or transplant a uterus and to somehow sustain a surrogate pregnancy, there might be some anti-abortionists who would be against *him* having an abortion - because they are against the killing of foetuses, *not* because they are against women doing what they want."
"t1_dgbenlw"	"berrieh"	"20"	"You're just repeating yourself. I've already explained why that doesn't matter."
"t1_dgbw5ag"	"moonflower"	"51"	"I thought perhaps if I paraphrased it, you might get it, but obviously it didn't work and you still don't get it."
"t1_dgbxzog"	"berrieh"	"20"	"Why would that help? I clearly understand you. I just think you're wrong, and you've presented nothing to suggest otherwise."
"t1_dgbzage"	"moonflower"	"51"	"If you understood it, you wouldn't be saying it's wrong."
"t1_dgc8gvn"	"berrieh"	"20"	"This is untrue. I can understand you without agreeing with you."
"t1_dgc900k"	"moonflower"	"51"	"If some, or probably most, anti-abortionists would also be against men having abortions, how is it inherently sexist to be against killing foetuses?"
"t1_dgca9x5"	"berrieh"	"20"	"Because the outcomes of such legislation are inherently sexist since men do not have to deal with this issue biologically. I explained this in my detailed answer to OP. As OP hasn't responded to me at all or to anyone in ages, I'm out, but you're not addressing my core points at all. Just saying random shit."
"t1_dgcadyg"	"moonflower"	"51"	"You are too rude, it is inappropriate for this subreddit, and I do not wish to talk to someone who is so rude."
"t1_dgcfghk"	"berrieh"	"20"	"Cool, I didn't really want to talk to you either, as I said."
