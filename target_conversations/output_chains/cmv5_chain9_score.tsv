I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dd7hpz2	hamataro	6	"I think what you're criticizing is people judging how \\responsible\\"" the woman is, and I do agree that seems unjustified. It ignores the actual consequences of the act of abortion, and tries to make it about the character of individuals rather than answering the big questions. However, the context of a pregnancy still matters. A common framework for making moral choices is utilitarianism, the principle of making the choice that will cause the most good, or cause the least harm. So long as we see the abortion of a fetus as a moral harm, no matter how great or how small, the question of whether it is justified depends on the alternative. Some religious people, for example, see the fetus as being identical to a human being, and no matter how harmful the alternative is, they will never see abortion as justified. Others think that a fetus is not fundamentally different from other internal organs, and consider abortion to be justified in almost all cases, even if the alternative isn't particularly bad. Because the alternative is carrying the pregnancy to term, abortion has to be morally evaluated against how harmful completing the pregnancy would be. For women who were raped, this can be a traumatic, emotional, and humiliating experience. Because of how painful that would be, abortion is more justified in her case than in some other cases. Not because of her purity, or her being a more responsible person than others, but because to her, not getting an abortion would cause so much pain."""	0.11709938198328018	0.4274646043777466	0.43512508273124695
