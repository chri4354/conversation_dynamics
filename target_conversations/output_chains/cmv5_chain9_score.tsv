0	awolz	First, a clarification: I am undecided as to whether abortion is morally right or wrong. I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	Amablue	36	Consider the following two scenarios:1. A driver maliciously runs over someone they hate, an ex perhaps, killing them. 2. A driver loses control of their car striking a pedestrian, killing them. Both of these situations in the abstract are very similar. A person behind the wheel of a car kills a person. However, that does not mean we treat these cases the same when they go to court. While the first driver will almost certainly go to jail, the second one may not. Despite being in essentially the same action, we deprive one person of their freedom and the other one we do not. The reason is obvious: The first driver made a conscious choice to do something, and is therefore must be held responsible for their choice. The second person did not decide to kill a person. Perhaps they were trying to swerve to miss something else, or the pedestrian was wearing black and jaywalking in the middle of the night, or the driver suffered a sudden seizure - there are all kinds of situations where the driver may have done little or nothing wrong. If this is the case, they are a victim of circumstance, and so we don't hold them accountable for the situation they were a part of. Many people believe that fetuses are alive, and that by having sex you are waiving your right to not be pregnant. To them, when you choose to take a risky action it's not permissible to commit murder to get out of dealing with the consequences of that action. However, if you are raped, that's not a situation you chose to be in. You never waived your right to your body. You didn't choose this situation, so your freedom isn't deprived. Yes, a life is still ended, but it wasn't your responsibility to give birth to that child in the first place. Note that I don't agree with that view, but if you accept the premises I gave then the logic makes sense.	0.06911134719848633
2	awolz	12	A lot of the points on this thread have been very convincing, but this most-so; the attention bought to the different ways we treat responsibility is more relevant than originally thought. ∆	0.4849734902381897
