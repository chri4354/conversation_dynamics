The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\a person\\"" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\""Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\""But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

4	t1_dj6tr5n	We_Are_Legion		"You're confusing \\start of human life\\"" as \\""point at which it is viable\\"" like most pro-choicers do. Which is complete and total bullshit fallacy. That is ridiculous to define as start of human life.The zygote is objectively the first stage in the development of every genetically complete unique human being, and as per the dictionary definition of person (a human being regarded as an individual), it is precisely a person.That this person may fail to survive is not an excuse to permit its intentional murder. By that logic, most of the 108 billion humans born in the last 50,000 years have died before the age of 10. Far more than your measly 30% casualty rate for zygotes. By the same logic, is someone under 5-10 not a human being?"""	0.005728541873395443	0.284440815448761	0.42119672894477844
5	t1_dj7ge9r	maverikv	4.0	I don't follow this criticism. How can the splitting of the zygote be conception? Conception is a defined term. It's the fertilization of the egg by the sperm.	0.5475945472717285	0.47912007570266724	0.29336410760879517

7	t1_dj7bje4	Katholikos	1.0	Glad we agree on this - surely you see the parallel, though? The child(ren) is conceived when fertilization occurs. You wouldn't say that a twin was conceived when a zygote splits.	0.9298758506774902	0.9471867680549622	0.032458335161209106
