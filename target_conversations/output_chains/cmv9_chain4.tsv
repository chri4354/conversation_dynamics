With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"

"t1_dgbqlcj"	"Ducktruck_OG"	NA	"Well, then you are just making an assumption that a panel of women would always support the pro-choice movement. Are you aware that there are many women in the pro-life movement? It wouldn't be hard to gather a panel's worth of women from the pro-life movement (including professional women, not just any protester from the street) that would come to the conclusion that abortion should be outlawed."
"t1_dgbpvte"	"[deleted]"	NA	"I think it is pretty telling though that they didn't even invite any women to the meeting."
"t1_dgbo2jp"	"Ducktruck_OG"	NA	"If a panel of female lawmakers came to the conclusion to outlaw abortion, would you accept their decision because they are women? The problem is not the identity of the people proposing the legislation, but the reasoning behind the legislation. It doesn't matter if they are a panel of men, women, or gender-fluid jaguars. We rate the legislation on its own merits. The point is that anyone could be a good or bad lawmaker."
"t1_dgbq5wp"	"Ducktruck_OG"	NA	"Can you answer my question though? Do you disagree with the content of their decision, or the identity of the people making the decision? If you disagree with the content of their decision, it doesn't matter who came to the conclusion."
"t1_dgavqzq"	"n_5"	"26"	"I don't think pro-choice folks typically paint the entire pro-life movement as sexist - for example, I have a few female friends who are staunchly pro-life who would consider themselves feminists as well. What people typically object to here is groups of exclusively men making decisions on abortion. Consider [this image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C7n2dJAX0AEoeXX.jpg) of Republican lawmakers making decisions on their party's healthcare bill (which of course includes decisions on birth control), and notice that there are literally zero women on this committee. The point many people (myself included) make when they say that being pro-life is sexist is not that feminists aren't allowed to be pro-life - they're mainly pointing out the tone-deafness of a group of people who will never be able to be pregnant making decisions regarding something they'll never personally experience."
