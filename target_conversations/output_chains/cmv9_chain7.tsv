"Milkshaketurtle79"	"I'm pro choice. I don't support abortion, but I support a woman's right to do as she pleases with her body. It's not my place to decide. With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"	NA
"Mitoza"	"6"	"Why does the case seem grey from an ethical standpoint? Even a fully grown adult dependant on your body for survival does not have a right to it. The only reason this seems grey is due to unexamined biases about how we expect the world to work on a human and gender level. We expect pregnant women to give their bodies for 9 months in favor of a baby's life because we expect afterwards a human will arrive and grow up and be a kid and we like humans. From my standpoint, the only position I've heard for anti-choice people is either idiocy in regards to ethics or sexism. I don't think there are other options. Idiocy in light of evidence or clarification is either an unconscious choice, and from there we can analyze what dissonance is causing the refusal, or it is a conscious choice, in which case it is politically motivated. In either case, overt or unconscious sexism surely plays a role."
"Hint227"	"5"	"Are you, and I am open to being showed the flaw here, but are you saying people are against abortion because they're stupid sexists? Or did I (please, for the love of God) misread that?"
"Mitoza"	"0"	"Stupid isn't the right word. Ignorant, uninformed, or even mislead work as well. And the qualifier is that they are either ignorant *or* sexist"
"Hint227"	"2"	"So, on your point, and please, feel free to explain, if I position myself against the murder of babies, I am *either* sexist or ignorant. Is that correct?"
"Mitoza"	"1"	"Yes"
"Hint227"	"2"	"I don't want to precipitate myself; can you please elaborate on your views?"
"aboy5643"	"1"	"The ignorance on the part of \\"pro-life\\" people is the failure to understand that the ethical argument for abortion is made not on the grounds of if a fetus is a person but that no person, a fetus included, does not have the right to use another person's body to live. If pregnancy was just incubating an egg in a machine for 9 months, termination of a pregnancy would be a much stickier ethical dilemma. As it stands, however, carrying a pregnancy to term requires the use of a mother's body and nutrients.Either you believe that a woman has no right to bodily autonomy and cannot make choices about who is allowed to use her body (which is the sexist half of the equation) or you do not understand the ethical question at hand (which is ignorance)."

Did someone run up to her and stab her with a baby-needle? (I know the analogies are tough to make, but give me a break). If a woman is impregnated against her will, then sure, she should have the right to end that pregnancy, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to say a baby can be murdered on the grounds of convenience.And let's be honest, this whole \\"nutrients\\" shit, it's to mask the convenience. It's an inconvenient thing to have a baby, and when someone gets pregnant but they're not in a 100% perfect spot for it (hint: nobody ever is), they think \\"eh, better murder it than lose on all that new year's booze\\". That's unfathomable. That's the kind of world a pro-choicer wants. As pro-life, as anti-murder, all I want is for the baby growing inside of the woman to have the most basic human right of all - the right to life. If you don't want to raise it, I'm 100% sure you can find a couple in the adoption line who will be glad to receive a baby boy or girl from your hands. But murder it for convenience is unacceptable. And even worse is this pseudo-scientific argument for \\"body and nutrients\\", like it even begins to justify the murder of a human being. P.S.: Let's play a game. Instead of using terms like \\"abort\\" and \\"terminate\\", why don't you, for your next answer, only refer to it as \\"murdering a baby\\". Maybe that sells the argument for ya.P.S.S.: [Ben Shapiro on abortions. A must-watch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDmwPGrZkYs)"

If a woman is impregnated against her will, then sure, she should have the right to end that pregnancy, but that doesn't mean I'm willing to say a baby can be murdered on the grounds of convenience.I'll give you the only scenario where I could not ethically defend abortion: an educated woman, fully aware that sexual intercourse can lead to pregnancy, with access to resources to prevent a pregnancy, has consensual unprotected sex with no birth control. Congratulations, you found a case I won't defend.If a person is either a) unaware of the consequences of intercourse or b) takes appropriate precautions to prevent pregnancy they are not morally culpable for the creation of new life.I'll give you an example (which is roughly taken from Judith Jarvis Thompson's famous essay, admittedly). Say someone owns a home. They go out of the house for a few hours, leaving the doors unlocked and the windows open, fully aware that they may be burgled. When they return home, their house has been robbed. A reasonable observer would say there is some amount of culpability on the homeowner not to secure their belongings in any way with full knowledge they may be taken. Now suppose we have someone who also owns a home. But when they go out of the house, they make sure to lock the doors and windows. They return home to a burgled house. What reasonable observer would claim this person was at fault in any way for being robbed? You may say, \\"Well they should have had an alarm.\\" Perhaps that's true but is that a *reasonable* expectation to have of someone to protect their valuables. I would say no. In the same way, if a woman practices reasonable birth control practices that are known to work in the vast majority of cases, there is no reasonable expectation of the woman to get pregnant. As for those uneducated, I'm sure you can figure the analogy out (for example a person who was never taught to lock the doors and windows when leaving -&gt; someone who was not educated about effective birth control practices; very common in the US).;And let's be honest, this whole \\"nutrients\\" shit, it's to mask the convenience. It's an inconvenient thing to have a baby, and when someone gets pregnant but they're not in a 100% perfect spot for it (hint: nobody ever is), they think \\"eh, better murder it than lose on all that new year's booze\\".

As pro-life, as anti-murder, all I want is for the baby growing inside of the woman to have the most basic human right of all - the right to life.None of this is a cogent argument for anything just your own musings on why people do things (likely filled entirely with projection of your own actions and beliefs or a fundamental attribution error of the motivations of others [exceedingly common for \\"pro-life\\" women who then get abortions because their reasons are noble but others' are not]) and your own personal beef with language. Why did you think this was something necessary to type?;And even worse is this pseudo-scientific argument for \\"body and nutrients\\", like it even begins to justify the murder of a human being.Ah yes, the most basic assertion of the rights of man, the right to bodily autonomy is just \\"pseudo-scientific argument for body and nutrients,\\" you caught me. Have you actually ever grappled with philosophy or are you only capable of emotional reactions to this issue? The fact that you insist on calling it \\"baby murder\\" (which does not accurately convey the meaning of what is happening) makes it abundantly clear that your position is emotional and not ethical. Ethics aren't \\"how you feel\\" about something, it is a set of assertions on right and wrong in the world that follow a consistent, logical set of axioms.Tell me: do people have a right to bodily autonomy in general? Does a woman have a right to bodily autonomy? Is a person obligated to allow someone else to use their body for the purpose of living? If you were to awake tomorrow hooked up to a dying man to allow him to live, would you be ethically obligated to stay attached to him? These are the ethical questions that must be answered. Crying \\"baby murder\\" isn't an argument, it's an emotional response, a response that doesn't stand up to logical scrutiny."
"Hint227"	"1"	"&gt; Starting with this because it's the most moronic thing I've ever heard. Maybe for your next answer you only refer to pro-life as \\"people who think women have no rights\\" and see how that argument sells for ya. Stupid suggestions get stupid responses.Using this one for measure. I'm not attacking you as a person, I'm aiming at your arguments. Pleare refrain from attacking my person.And also, you didn't do it, so neither shall I.; If a person is either a) unaware of the consequences of intercourse or b) takes appropriate precautions to prevent pregnancy they are not morally culpable for the creation of new life.Ok, we are assuming someone in reproductive age doesn't know that having sex leads to pregnancy. Alright, way down we go. If someone is in the age of having intercourse (i.e., they're over the consent age [I know people have sex before that, but even then, come on]) it is only logical to assume they know that sex makes babies. You cannot be in the age of thinking about rolling in the hay with the pretty ladies and still believe in the magical stork that brings babies to married couples. And, as I said in the first post, no one is ever ready to have a baby - and the contraceptive methods are written *in the containers* that they're not 100% efficient. There are only three methods of intercourse that are 100% efficient: not penetrating, not penetrating the vagina, and not having sex. If you're having sex, and you are in a biological position to have a chance to get pregnant, there is still a chance. ; I'll give you an example (which is roughly taken from Judith Jarvis Thompson's famous essay, admittedly).This example equates the home being robbed to a woman getting pregnant, one that is taking precautions, and the other who isn't. What I find hard to swallow for the argument to go full circle is that, in the end, no one inside the house dies! I mean, if we're equating a robbery to an abortion, why don't you talk about the part where the baby dies? Is it because **it's unethical to kill a baby for convenience?**; None of this is a cogent argument for anything just your own musings on why people do thingsWho are you to say it isn't a part of it? I'm not saying it's 100% of the cases (it obviously isn't) but, if you're talking about people that don't even know sex makes babies (as if), then surely you must be able to see that some people would have an abortion not to miss a party, or not to lose out on their early 20's, or to keep fit, or to keep their night-job at the local club, or whatever. Again, unethical reasons to kill a baby. And, from what I've seen on Reddit threads about the subject, Reddit doesn't like it when people that work with abortions ask the mother about the baby, and/or try to dissuade her. ; Have you actually ever grappled with philosophy or are you only capable of emotional reactions to this issue?Have you ever grappled with the ethics of ending a human life, and how do you feel about defending someone's right to murder someone else, or are you only capable of screaming \\"ETHICS\\" to anyone who comes near?; The fact that you insist on calling it \\"baby murder\\" (which does not accurately convey the meaning of what is happening) Two questions:1. Is the fetus growing inside of you a human fetus?2. If you don't attempt against its life, will it come out of your womb as a baby human?; Tell me: do people have a right to bodily autonomy in general? Does a woman have a right to bodily autonomy? Is a person obligated to allow someone else to use their body for the purpose of living? If you were to awake tomorrow hooked up to a dying man to allow him to live, would you be ethically obligated to stay attached to him?Can you seriously, no-joke, 100% not see the difference between being randomly hooked up to a machine (if I'm waking up to it, it's probably against my will, the one abortion I agreed with - the one in case of rape), and you actively taking a decision that has a chance of leading to pregnancy? Where do you draw your \\"bodily autonomy\\" line? If someone touches your shoulder without written permission, will you cut their hand off? It's your body, they can't invade it. We aren't discussing the case of a woman getting \\"hooked up to a dying man\\" (sic), we're talking about a woman growing a life inside of her! A life that's half-her! How can you say this is ethical? It certainly is moral - anything is. But ethical? From the wiki: [Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics). Ethics is the main branch, it's the example from which the morals of the people spread. I can't call someone \\"immoral\\" without having an ideal ethical code to follow (Plato's perfect being reflects this). So, your notion of \\"ethical\\" places a woman's right to \\"bodily autonomy\\" (against her own child) over the child's right to life. Is that ehtical?; Crying \\"baby murder\\" isn't an argument, it's an emotional response, a response that doesn't stand up to logical scrutiny.[INB4: Reductio ad hitlerum, I know.] Then I guess saying \\"jew murder\\" was an emotional response, not an argument. I mean, the Germans had a right to spacial autonomy, and those Anne Franks were, like, invading their space. That argument's rubbish, but it's necessary to show that it's almost the same thing."
"sistersunbeam"	"1"	"\\"Spatial autonomy\\" is not a thing. \\"Bodily autonomy\\" actually is."
"Hint227"	"1"	"Hello! Nice to meet you. I can see that, but it's necessary to point out the absolutes this Sith is dealing with when he/she talks like that."
"sistersunbeam"	"1"	"If spatial autonomy isn't a thing, then your joke about \\"jew murder\\" doesn't make sense. Even if we're weighing \\"baby murder\\" against bodily autonomy, bodily autonomy is real thing. One might argue that carrying a fetus to term is more important that the right to bodily autonomy, but bodily autonomy still has to be acknowledged. (As for Siths and absolutes, you've thrown around more \\"100%\\" than anyone else in this discussion...)The criticism is that simply saying \\"baby murder\\", you're not engaging with the tension between a human's (in this case, woman's) right to bodily autonomy and the needs of a fetus/unborn baby. Where does bodily autonomy start and end for you? In the case of rape or incest is an abortion permissible? Bodily autonomy isn't about whether or not someone touches your shoulder (though it might become so if you said \\"please don't touch my shoulder\\" and they continued to do so). It's about you being the sole decider of what your body does and where it goes and what goes into it (food, medicine, other people's body parts). If you want to discuss with pro-choice folks, you gotta engage with that. The same way pro-choice people have to argue that they don't see abortion as murder. If bodily autonomy isn't important to you in this case, explain why."

Where does bodily autonomy start and end for you? In the case of rape or incest is an abortion permissible?Again, hello. If you follow the comment chain, the only rape[edit: the only abortion] I tolerate is the one in case of rape. Or, obvious, when the pregnancy threatens the woman's life. And that's where I draw the \\"bodily autonomy\\" line. If you are having a baby, it's because you took the decision to have sex, the one thing that leads to babies. Unless you didn't make the decision to have sex, or the pregnancy might actually kill or seriously harm you, then you should not be able to murder a human being on any pretext, be it convenience, bodily autonomy, religion, desire, whatever. As a pro-life, I only ask for one thing: please, please don't make the murder of a baby into an everyday thing. Only do it in the most extreme of cases.Also, I'm 100% certain that only a Sith deals in absolutes."
"sistersunbeam"	"2"	"&gt;...the only rape [sic] I tolerate is the one in case of rape. I don't understand this distinction. If abortion is the murder of a baby, it's the murder of a baby, regardless of how the baby ended up in the woman. If abortion is only allowed in cases of rape, then the objection to abortion cannot solely be an objection based on the murder of a child. The argument is that if you *chose* to have sex, you must give birth to any fetus that results. Why is it that fetus' that result from consensual sex get more rights that fetus' that don't?"
"Hint227"	"1"	"&gt; If abortion is the murder of a baby, it's the murder of a baby, regardless of how the baby ended up in the woman.That's why I said \\"tolerate\\". Because I don't want any babies to die, but I'm not a monster, and I understand that a baby that's fruit of a rape could be a potential damage on the mother that goes far beyond itself. So, no, it's not that the babies from normal sex get more rights - it's just this pro-life guy thinking about the mother too."

So, no, it's not that the babies from normal sex get more rights - it's just this pro-life guy thinking about the mother too. Then murder is okay, in some cases. I assume you acknowledge that, in the case of rape, the damage the pregnancy does to the mother is not necessarily physical but mental. I appreciate that, thank you. Rape is not the only instance when pregnancy can \\"be a potential damage on the mother that goes far beyond itself.\\" Most women who have abortions already have at least one child and are worried about their financial and emotional ability to care for another child. I suspect you'd argue that those women can simply give their children up for adoption, but carrying a baby to term and then giving it up can be incredibly emotionally traumatizing. It used to be very common for young girls and unwed mothers to be forced to give birth and then give their children up (I'd suggest reading [Beggars and Choosers](https://www.amazon.com/Beggars-Choosers-Politics-Adoption-Abortion/dp/0809028603) if that aspect interests you are all). And simply being pregnant can be emotionally and physically traumatic. A dear friend of mine is pregnant right now (7 mos) and she had a blood clot, which not only almost killed her, but made her a high risk pregnancy. She's been in physical pain for most of her pregnancy, struggled with nausea, and is now worried about any future pregnancies. The reality is that the prospect of being pregnant and having a child that you cannot care for is, in itself, traumatic. There are lasting repercussions and damages, not only to the mother and the child, but any other children the woman may have. Women know these repercussions and damages, and have in the past done may terrifying, dangerous, and illegal things to avoid them. That's the world we return to when we outlaw abortion. If we truly want fewer abortions, we should focus on providing everyone with a living wage so poor women can raise their kids. We need affordable child care for everyone so working women can provide for their kids, we need paid parental leave so parents don't have to worry about losing their jobs if they become unexpectedly pregnant. We need universal health care so poor women can get pre- and post-natal care and so their children can get the care they need, and any children with physical or mental disabilities can get the care they need. We need comprehensive, sex-positive sex education so that couples understand how pregnancy does and doesn't happen and can effectively avoid it. And we need safe, legal, and accessible abortion providers so that women don't die trying to get illegal abortions."
