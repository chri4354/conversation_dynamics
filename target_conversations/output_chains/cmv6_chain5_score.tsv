1	bathingcanady	1	So, in your ideal society women should have to have children they don't want? What about the ones with mental disorders, histories of drug abuse, or those that have no money or family? And please don't stay adoption.	0.8036342263221741
2	Reason_is_Key	1	Why isn't adoption a viable route?	0.8075358271598816
3	bathingcanady	1	Have you ever been in foster care?	0.18505962193012238
4	Reason_is_Key	1	I have not; have you?	
5	bathingcanady	1	"Yes. I would've been better off aborted, to say the least. My life is \\okay\\"" but I still hate using black plastic bags, I still hate admitting I was in foster care. Those were the worst years of my life, and they have effected my life severely since then. Of course there's the foster success stories, but those people are far in between."""	0.9999376535415649
6	Reason_is_Key	1	I'm sorry to hear that. Are you sure you are not grateful at all for your life?	0.9336321353912354
7	bathingcanady	1	No. I've attempted suicide multiple times. The first when I was 10, and walked into a river with cement blocks tied to myself. You should never force a child into the world under horrible conditions. I will always be scared of men because of things that happened in foster care. I will always latch on to my friends parents because I never had real ones. I will always have spouts of insane jealousy at people who do have parents. There are some voids that cannot be filled. The only reason I'm still alive now is because I'm living for the sake of people who care about me, which is sad, because I still want to pick death over them.	0.02704015001654625
8	Reason_is_Key	1	I am sorry to hear that :-( I once struggled with depression as well and it is really an awful thing to have. I truly hope that you get better and that life ends up becoming a more pleasant experience. I hate to argue, especially since you've experienced this. So, if you do not want to respond, that is fine. I don't want to inconvenience you any further and make you relive your past again. What I would respond to what you said though is: should poor people, therefore, not be allowed to have children. Surely, their children will be brought up in a very awful environment. What do you think?	0.45375755429267883
9	bathingcanady	1	There will never be a way to legally regulate people's ability to reproduce besides incarceration or under serious rehabilitation. Which is why DCS and DFS departments are in place. The trick is convincing people that it's okay to not pass on their genetic material, and to adopt instead of reproducing. If I had been adopted by great parents, my life would've went much differently. The system gives up on a lot of children and returns them to abusive homes. By the way, I'm not usually this depressing. Even I have small joys in life, such as night time car rides, my dogs, and traveling. But most of life's joys require money if everything else around you kind of just sucks.	0.0004286862094886601
