I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

For example, a government would use morality in order to determine whether or not to pass a law. If X welfare act is passed it will save 150,000 lives, while the cost only comes out of the rich that have so much money they could never hope to spend it all in their lifetime. The question is, what is the guideline by which morality determines the best action? The answered by looking at the factors that apply to morality: namely sentience and autonomy. Sentience is the ability to feel pain, undergo suffering; and to feel pleasure. In short, undergo positive and negative mental states. If an entity does not possess either of these qualities, moral theory does not apply. For example, what is an immoral action you could do to a rock? It does not feel pain or pleasure, and does not have the consciousness to realize its own will. Autonomous beings must take into account the overall pleasure and suffering created by an action, as well as the limits to the autonomy of beings. Although confining someone in a room against their will doesn't cause them any pain, their autonomy is violated because they do not wish to be confined. But, if confining them against their will prevents a greater suffering, for example if a criminal was released it would lead to the deaths or injury of any number of people. Thus, confining a criminal is just. In short, moral theory is made up of the ratio of pleasure to suffering created by an action. In the case of an abortion, the fetus does not feel pain at 24 weeks. At this point in the life of a fetus the fetus has the consciousness of a worm, and cannot realize its own autonomy. What moral properties does it possess that could dictate whether an action against it would be immoral? None exists. There is nothing immoral you can do to something that doesn't feel pain and isn't conscious. Thinking otherwise is antilogic and antireality.
