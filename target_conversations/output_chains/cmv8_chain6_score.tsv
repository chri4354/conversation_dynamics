The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\a person\\"" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\""Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\""But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

1	t1_dj6cnot	bguy74	92.0	"Arguing that there _other places where we fail to save lives_ is not an argument for adding another, or sustaining another. That's like saying \\there is evil in the world so we should be OK with more evil\\"". The bodily autonomy position embeds your argument - the interest of preserving ones right to expel things from inside their body that they don't want there trumps a concern about the sanctity of the life the fetus that happens to be inside you. It subordinates the life of the fetus to an idea that our rights to control our body are more important the life."""	0.9973076581954956	0.9906101226806641	0.013202128000557423
2	t1_dj76973	human_machine		That's not an argument which stands up to near future bio-tech developments into [artificial wombs](http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/25/525044286/scientists-create-artificial-womb-that-could-help-prematurely-born-babies). People are starting to get concerned about that: ;There's also a danger such devices might be used coercively. States could theoretically require women getting abortions to put their fetuses into artificial wombs, says Scott Gelfand, a bioethicist at Oklahoma State University. If we're going to defend abortion then we're ultimately going to need a better answer as to why it's OK.	0.27126821875572205	0.4539538025856018	0.4560142457485199
3	t1_dj76i8a	bguy74	92.0	forcing a specific medical procedure on a women is hardly something that alleviates the concern.I think that if someone can create a baby without a women's body then we'll have a serious ethical question (e.g. if a man can drop his sperm into an artificial womb along with an egg and then they terminate the fetus 6 months in). That is a _different concern_. I'm not interested in preserving a right to _kill fetuses_, I'm interested in preserving the rights of women (and men) to exercise domain over their bodies. But...that includes what is _done to their bodies by doctors_.	0.6342995762825012	0.607377290725708	0.22396694123744965
4	t1_dj78ahp	human_machine		"We already have legal restrictions regarding when abortions are allowed and some restrictions on how they may be performed. Those guidelines were established as part of Roe v. Wade and broadly speaking they have to do with fetal viability outside the woman. As long as this transplant process isn't significantly more invasive than a medical abortion I don't see that being an overriding argument to those guidelines. It's also just another matter of refining processes and technology until this is the case which isn't a solution as much add it is kicking the rock down the road. We've generally accepted that women are entitled to legally pursue terminating a pregnancy within some limits but I don't know why a new version of that which still produces a person couldn't be enforced. That pregnancy would still be terminated and her bodily autonomy would be uninterrupted. In fact, under those Supreme Court guidelines it's easy to see how we could get to this situation. I do believe that it's something conservative lawmakers might really want to push and we're getting sort of good on the medical front so this isn't some sci-fi \\what if\\"". If we're going to keep some version of the stasis quo then we'll need a new reason to explain why this right exists in this way."""	0.15415263175964355	0.4230835437774658	0.44908368587493896

6	t1_dj7dmuy	human_machine		This autonomy we have now isn't full autonomy. Currently it's legally balanced against fetal viability which is a problem as the window of fetal viability has been growing and we're on the verge of it encompassing an entire pregnancy. What we would need for something like full autonomy would be to get legal backing for the idea that a viable fetus is a woman's sole property with absolutely no independent rights or eligible for legal independent consideration. The key thing here is that this isn't the case now and and we'd need to change our understanding of why this feature of society exists to preserve it in its current form.	0.03737157583236694	0.05430825799703598	0.044741012156009674
7	t1_dj7drvy	bguy74	92.0	You're creating a very false equivalent around the bodily autonomy concept.In the fake womb scenario we're talking about _compelling_ someone to perform a medical procedure. That's not part of any current abortion law (although is well established part of medical law generally).	0.8008320927619934	0.6781461238861084	0.32298973202705383
