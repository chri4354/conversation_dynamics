I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception.As far as I understand the prime argument for Pro-Choice is that the woman should be able to choose what she does with her body period. She is the one responsible for feeding the embryo for 9 months and eventually birthing it into this world, the man only provides insemination.My biggest issue with this statement however comes from the part where you imply that women who aren't raped but choose to get an abortion are using it as a contraceptive. I think this is MAYBE true in a number of women so small it shouldn't even be considered.The primary reason for getting an abortion would be health concerns, which you've said you think is morally justifiable (this is a hard metric to judge anything on since your morals can vary wildly from someone else's).Secondary could be financial, it is significantly more cost effective for society for a mother who cannot afford a child to get an abortion than it is for her to place that child into the adoption system. Abortion offers a method of population control that becomes vitally important the larger humanity's population grows.And the last could be circumstances of the pregnancy. Your argument seems to be hinged around this where you believe that even if the circumstances are out of a woman's control she still is morally wrong to kill the fetus, others have pointed out that having the child of your rapist could be mentally trying for a mother and lead to suicide (or even abuse of the child). I'd also point out that sometimes these children could be unplanned and that could lead back into financial reasoning for abortions.When it comes down to morality the question really boils down to what you consider an embryo to be. If you think that a woman is carrying a human at this point then it would be difficult to coax you into the belief that there is no black morality involved with abortion. For me personally, embryo aren't human yet, at that point in their life they are extremely close to parasites. They cannot survive without the mother's influence so the mother should be given right to choose what to do with something that uses her own bodily resources to sustain itself.	0.9979696869850159	0.8731278777122498	0.2548837959766388
