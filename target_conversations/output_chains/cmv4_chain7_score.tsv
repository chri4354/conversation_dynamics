Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9940117001533508
1	PikklzForPeepl	8	&gt; If we recognize free will as simply an illusionThen the whole point of law and the justice system crumbles and is meaningless. If we have no free will, there is no point in discussing this because nothing can be done to change people's views.	0.0008632252574898303
2	jessebanjo	1	The point of law and justice is still relevant to protect people from suffering.	0.00846085511147976
3	Sadsharks	6	But if free will is an illusion, nobody can choose to have an abortion anyway. They also can't choose to have sex, to rape, to punish others for crime, etc.	0.9738801717758179

5	Sheexthro	3	But it's actually a pretty important sidebar. If we **recognize** that free will is an illusion then the entire moral and logical basis of law collapses - laws can no more bind my behavior than anything else, because I am unfree and the iron chain of causality forces me to my inevitable end no matter what.	0.9969478845596313
