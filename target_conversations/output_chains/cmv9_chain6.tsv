With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"

Thus they are responsible for its consequences."
"t1_dgb0mfk"	"SobanSa"	NA	"The problem with many arguments for abortion is that they deny the bodily autonomy of the babies. What we have to do is balance the violations. I don't know about you, but killing someone is a pretty big violation of their bodily autonomy. Therefore, it seems to me that the temporary non-lethal violation is probably a better alternative to the permanently lethal one."
"t1_dgb10jw"	"RajonRondoIsTurtle"	"5"	"Fetuses, not babies, are by definition not autonomous and thus do not have these rights."
"t1_dgb1n0t"	"SobanSa"	NA	"That's debatable. For example, the off the cuff definition of bodily autonomy is the inviolability of the physical body. I don't think anyone would argue that they don't have a body given that's what is causing the problem in the first place. So I think we would have to pin down exactly how we mean autonomy. We have to consider what other impacts our definition might have. For example, if someone goes on life support, does that mean that they lose their bodily autonomy?"
