0	t3_69us5b	buzzardsgutsman		"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."""	0.9958481788635254	0.742600679397583	0.3838673532009125

2	t1_dh9jb5g	buzzardsgutsman		Pregnant women can also rescind their parental rights once the child is born in a matter of months. Yes that means they will have to go through the pregnancy, but equally a parent would have to continue to take care of their child until the state takes it off them, which is certainly not instant. Ultimately, I think if you're using a completely black &amp; white ideological argument to support bodily autonomy in pregnancy (saying a woman should be able to rescind her obligation absolutely anytime), you have to use the same standard for parenting as a whole, in which case child neglect should be legal. If you're starting to throw pragmatic elements into it, then its only fair you do the same for pregnancy/abortion, in which case I can only conclude that abortion shouldn't be allowed.	0.651272177696228	0.5800002217292786	0.419849693775177

If the technology existed such that we could remove the fetus without killing it, then I'd agree with a law that required using that and giving it up instead of killing the fetus. But since we do not have that technology, the fetus still doesn't have any right to use the women's body without her consent.; If you're starting to throw pragmatic elements into it, then its only fair you do the same for pregnancy/abortion, in which case I can only conclude that abortion shouldn't be allowed.How does saying a woman rescind her obligation at any time translate to child neglect being legal? In the case of a child, in order to rescind her obligations she must ensure the child is taken care of by *someone* ie: giving it up for adoption, dropping it at a safe haven, etc. In the case of a fetus, the woman's right to her own body trumps any rights you may assign to the fetus which most would argue does not have the same rights as a child.	0.5692517161369324	0.5311959385871887	0.3508256673812866
4	t1_dh9kpy3	buzzardsgutsman		Why does she have to ensure that, though? Like I said, you are bringing a pragmatic element in here: A parent can rescind their obligation to take care of their child as it is their choice, but since neglecting it outright wouldn't be a very nice thing to do, they should make sure it is taken care of first.I don't see how it's any different to say that a woman can rescind her right to take care of a foetus as it is her choice, but since crushing it with a pair of forceps and pulling it piece by piece out of her body isn't very nice, she should wait till the foetus can survive outside her and then give it to someone else to care for.	0.9996743202209473	0.6666380167007446	0.4709863066673279
5	t1_dh9ssgr	z3r0shade	46.0	The difference is whether or not she has to risk her own life, health, and wellbeing. It's a conflict of rights. In the case of a child having to be dropped off or given up for adoption, the child has a right to life and the mother does not have to risk her own health, well-being and potentially her life in order to give it up for adoption, as such the child's right to not be abused trumps her right to neglect it. In the case of a fetus, it has no right to the woman's body and has no right to continue to use her body nor the right to force her to risk her life for it. It's the exact same reason why we can arrest a parent for neglecting their child until it starves but we can't legally force them to donate an organ to their dying child	0.717428982257843	0.5464873313903809	0.41385984420776367
6	t1_dh9y3x5	MnemonicFitness		&gt;The difference is whether or not she has to risk her own life, health, and wellbeing.But risks come in degrees. The mother could say that taking the child to the adoption centre still involves risks to her wellbeing, such as getting run over by a car en-route, or contracting the flu from a random pedestrian. In other words, there is a non-zero percent chance of her health and maybe even life getting hurt. Is it acceptable to force these risks on the mother? If they are, does that mean that the mother should be forced to give birth as long as the risks associated with pregnancy are lowered to some predetermined level?;In the case of a fetus, it has no right to the woman's body and has no right to continue to use her body nor the right to force her to risk her life for it.This case needs to be argued for, because the fetus is in this situation due to the actions of the mother. Imagine me taking a risk on your behalf. By doing something, I get a lot of pleasure, but I know there is a 50% chance of you becoming dependent of me to survive. I don't really want that to happen, so I take risk minimizing measures and bring it down to 3% and I figure that's good enough. I keep taking that risk and one day the risk actualizes and you get dependent of me.You never consented to this kind of risk, you didn't even know I took it on your behalf. Now you need to stay attached to me in order to survive. But I invoke bodily autonomy and say that you have no right to my organs. I detach myself and you die. Is it justified for me to endanger you like that for my own purposes and then let you die for it? ;It's the exact same reason why we can arrest a parent for neglecting their child until it starves but we can't legally force them to donate an organ to their dying childWhy not? The parent still needs to use her body to feed the child, especially if we're talking about breastfeeding. It's called bodily autonomy, not organ autonomy.

What's relevant is that the act causes this kind of situation to exist - it creates the situation, where someone is in fact dependent of you to survive. OP-s prior description thus distorts the underlying reality that it's the mother who creates the situation where the fetus becomes dependent of her, and she takes this risk knowingly.
