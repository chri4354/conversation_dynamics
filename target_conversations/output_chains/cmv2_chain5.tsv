"curiouscat145"	"I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible."

"_gweilowizard_"	"5"	"The question of the morality of abortion is really only dependent on one thing: does the unborn fetus deserve rights? If the answer to that question is yes, abortion is essentially murder. If the answer is no, abortion is probably fine (though further discussion is needed to define exactly how to treat fetuses).Any valid argument about the morality of abortion has to answer that question."
"blubox28"	"2"	"Deserving rights is not an all or nothing thing. My dog has certain rights but I still have the right to kill him. But even then I am required to do it in as humane way as possible. The further down the evolutionary ladder the fewer right we generally ascribe to the organism in question. The same applies to a fetus as it develops into a baby and is finally born. But even then we do not give all of the same rights to children as we do to adults."
"mutesa1"	"1"	"&gt; But even then we do not give all of the same rights to children as we do to adults.But we still give them basic human rights, which includes life. You can't compare fetuses to dogs because dogs aren't human."
"blubox28"	"1"	"Why not? By my criteria (Secular Humanism) an adult dog is closer to \\"human\\" than a zygote or early fetus. You are getting stuck by a label. I understand if your religion affords such an attribute on a fetus, but if you are trying to make a universal moral, or legal, argument then you are assuming your conclusion."
"mutesa1"	"1"	"Even by your criteria, you should still apply basic science. When you were a fetus you were less related to your mother than a dog? Come on man, don't be ridiculous."
"blubox28"	"2"	"Basic science? You missed my point entirely. There is no \\"basic science\\" on how you apply a meaningless label. My skin cells are clearly human cells, should they have more rights than my dog? Should my sperm cells be considered \\"human\\" and be afforded full human rights? If not, then how is my relation to my father and mother relevant since they came through haploid cells? Or do you think that each is somehow \\"half\\" human and the resulting diploid cell is fully human?"
"mutesa1"	"1"	"Your skin cells won't develop into an adult human, and neither will sperm cells that haven't fertilised an egg. Without your interference, a fetus will continue to grow and develop and become a human like us. That doesn't happen with skin cells or the sperm you jizz into a Kleenex."
"blubox28"	"1"	"Okay, but why would that make a difference to bestowing of human rights? It is almost certainly the case that there is a way to change at least some kind of normal cells into stem cells that can grow into a full human. And you brought the \\"related\\" to argument into it, which still goes through haploid germ cells, so by your own reasoning there is a discontinuity of rights here. But you are still getting hung up by labels. Why does a single human cell get rights but a single dog cell doesn't? There is no other kind of single cell that we accord any rights to whatsoever. The international standard for bioethics on developing human cell experimentation is 14 days. Scientists worldwide basically decided that in the first 14 days it is okay to do what ever you want to a humane zygote as long as you destroy it before the 15th day. In the first 14 days the cells are all undifferentiated cells, with no difference between themselves and any other zygote of any other mammal except for a very small percentage of the DNA."
"mutesa1"	"1"	"I'm hung up by labels because labels are incredibly important. Both sides of the abortion debate rest upon with what label does one give to a fetus; a human (pro-life), or a clump of cells (pro-choice)? If it's a human, then the fetus deserves the same basic human rights that you and I enjoy. if it's just a clump of cells, throwing it away in the trash is no different than cleaning up after a masturbation session. I'm also not sure what the relevance of the 14 day thing is to this is. If anything, it weakens the pro-choice position. Why is it not okay to experiment on embryos past 14 days, but it's okay to kill them well past that point? The 14 day limit isn't the same as saying \\"okay, now it's actually alive.\\" It's an arbitrary limit. Switzerland restricts it to 7 days. Are 7-day old fetuses in Switzerland more alive than 7-day old fetuses in America?"
"blubox28"	"1"	"\\"Clump of cells\\" is not a label, it is a description that conveys nothing morally of import one way or the other. You want to have your label mean the difference between one moral set of attributes and another for no apparent reason. Let me put it another way, let us stipulate that this clump of cells is human and that clump of cells is not. Why should that fact be morally relevant in any way?The point I was making with the 14 day limit is that when setting up those rules, there was unanimous agreement that a single human stem cell had no rights whatsoever. And if a single such cell had no rights, two such identical cells could not have them either. For the first 14 days all the cell division results in two identical cells. On the 15th day however, cells started to differentiate and they were no longer identical. Everyone agrees that a new born baby has essentially all human rights. They all agreed that a single human cell had none. They all agreed where ever they might each personally draw the line, that line could not meaningfully come before the 15th day."
"mutesa1"	"1"	"It is a label. Labels are important because they carry meaning. If I called you a \\"clump of cells\\", I would be technically correct. Every organism is a clump of cells, including humans. But most people would take that as a devaluing insult. ; Let me put it another way, let us stipulate that this clump of cells is human and that clump of cells is not. Why should that fact be morally relevant in any way?If one clump of cells, if unhindered, will develop into a human like you and I, and the other clump will just remain a clump, then yes, that fact is very morally relevant. ; The point I was making with the 14 day limit is that when setting up those rules, there was unanimous agreement that a single human stem cell had no rights whatsoever.

They all agreed that a single human cell had none. They all agreed where ever they might each personally draw the line, that line could not meaningfully come before the 15th day.Well apparently agreement *wasn't* unanimous because some countries have different rules on the matter. So no, the worldwide scientific community isn't in consensus on this."
"blubox28"	"1"	"Subsequently there have been politically and religiously motivated changes to the laws of some countries. Until the abortion issue became so a polarizing topic, the scientific community *was* in agreement. If you said I was *only* a clump of cells, then I might take issue with that. But otherwise, not so much. ; If one clump of cells, if unhindered, will develop into a human like you and I, and the other clump will just remain a clump, then yes, that fact is very morally relevant.So you think it is the potential that is the deciding factor? Then why not accord the rights of a dog to the single stem cell of a dog? You are dancing around the real issue here, why you think that the term \\"human\\" is special. Out of the trillions of single cell organisms in the world, you accord no rights to any of them except this one particular kind, and for this one kind you seem to want to accord the full rights of the multi-cell organism it might some day become. Nature doesn't do that. Somewhere between 25 and 50% of all such single human stem cell organisms never develop into self-sufficient multi-cell humans, left to themselves, by nature."
