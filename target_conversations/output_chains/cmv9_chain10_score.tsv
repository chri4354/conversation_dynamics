0	Milkshaketurtle79	I'm pro choice. I don't support abortion, but I support a woman's right to do as she pleases with her body. It's not my place to decide. With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!		
1	Mitoza	6	Why does the case seem grey from an ethical standpoint? Even a fully grown adult dependant on your body for survival does not have a right to it. The only reason this seems grey is due to unexamined biases about how we expect the world to work on a human and gender level. We expect pregnant women to give their bodies for 9 months in favor of a baby's life because we expect afterwards a human will arrive and grow up and be a kid and we like humans. From my standpoint, the only position I've heard for anti-choice people is either idiocy in regards to ethics or sexism. I don't think there are other options. Idiocy in light of evidence or clarification is either an unconscious choice, and from there we can analyze what dissonance is causing the refusal, or it is a conscious choice, in which case it is politically motivated. In either case, overt or unconscious sexism surely plays a role.	0.9917106628417969

5	Mitoza	1	That's just the above assertion in longer form. You need to justify it.	0.0024433182552456856
6	krimin_killr21	3	That would be like asking me to justify a preference for chocolate over vanilla. It's my moral belief. I don't need to justify it any further. And to add to that, there are many millions of people who hold the same opinion.	0.3042120933532715
7	Mitoza	3	Moral beliefs need justification, they aren't just opinions. The idea that many people agree doesn't make you right. If 51% of people believed killing the other 49% was morally justified, it would not make them morally correct	0.07065676897764206
8	krimin_killr21	2	&gt;Moral beliefs need justification, they aren't just opinions.I completely disagree with that. And I don't think logically you could prove otherwise.While I'd be happy to engage in the meta-ethical debate about whether moral statements are facts (and if they are, what standard defined their truth value), that's not the present debate.You're saying (correct me if I'm wrong) that if I think a capricious third trimester abortion is tantamount to the murder of a new born that I must be sexist because there's no other basis upon which I could make that judgement. I'm saying that the basis upon which I say that that is wrong is that you have to be accountable for the support of those who depend on you if you made them so dependant by your own wrecklessness. You are free to say that I am unjustified in this belief, but I still win the point, because I have demonstrated that I am against capricious third trimester abortions on a basis other than sexism, even if that basis is, in your opinion, unjustified.	0.635151743888855
9	Mitoza	2	Even if you're insisting on the notion that moral beliefs are just opinions that can't be wrong, you still have a stake in justifying why it is that you believe those things. You would be suspicious of my basis if I declared it good to steal from you specifically. What you say you position is and what it is informed by are two distinct things.	0.00011824641842395067
10	krimin_killr21	2	I agree with you. But at some point you get to something that can't be further justified. I suppose though I could demonstrate it by comparison.Suppose that I give a child an incurable liver disease for which I was the only known viable donor. Knowing that I can donate some of my liver and still survive, am I obligated morally to give that child part of my liver?	0.9990331530570984

14	krimin_killr21	1	Well it's best easier to present the argument for that, since that's my position, so that's what I'll do.There is a point during gestation before which a foetus is more so a group of cells than a human being. After this point, the foetus starts approximating a human being more and more so each day, until it's born. A woman who is pregnant and in a liberal democracy will generally have ample opportunity to abort the pregnancy before this point. By choosing to delay her abortion until this point arrives, she allows a dependant human being to exist, where otherwise one would not. If she makes this choice, she forfeits her right to bodily autonomy against the child because:;If someone is made dependent upon you for their survival through your own fault, you are responsible for their survival, even at cost to yourself.	0.9672894477844238

17	Mitoza	1	"&gt;The question is morally whether it's permissible if she waits because she's capricious.Actually it's not. Whether or not she's capricious makes no difference to the moral argument.
