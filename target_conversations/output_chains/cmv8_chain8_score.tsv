The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\a person\\"" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\""Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\""But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

1	cp5184	7	Two quick things to point out, one, just imagine the case of aborting a blastocyst or whatever a second after the sperm penetrates the egg.Think about that for a while, remember about how the menstral cycle works and so on.The other thing to point out is that the vast majority of pregnancy terminations are natural. Think about all the pregnancies that end naturally. Are lives lost in the first few months if a pregnancy comes to a natural end?	0.9366704821586609
2	Daniel_A_Johnson	4	&gt; The other thing to point out is that the vast majority of pregnancy terminations are natural. Think about all the pregnancies that end naturally. Are lives lost in the first few months if a pregnancy comes to a natural end?As I pointed out elsewhere, the vast majority of deaths in the first few decades of life happen under age 5, so this isn't really as hard a distinction as you'd think.	0.0009991703554987907
3	MerrieLee	5	You bring up an irrelevant statistic. We aren't talking about how living breathing human beings die. We're talking about at what point does a developing embryo or fetus deserve the same rights as already born people. Bringing up the rates of success or destruction of embryos and fetuses are the various stages of prenatal development is a fair point when trying to determine at what stage of prenatal development that embryo or fetus becomes deserving of human rights.	0.6616674065589905
4	Daniel_A_Johnson	8	"If I say, \\A fetus is a person. Birth is irrelevant.\\""And then you say, \\""Lots of fetuses die before birth,\\"" to mean that they are less worthy of protection.How is that different from:I say \\""A baby is a person. Reaching age six is irrelevant.\\""And then someone says, \\""Lots of babies die before age five\\"" to mean that they are less worthy of protection."""	0.8648940920829773
5	MerrieLee	7	"Because under what debate or context would you say \\A baby is a person. Reaching age six is irrelevant.\\""? Under what debate or context are we talking about whether or not it is okay to kill already born people? None. We aren't talking about that. We're talking about a very specific situation in which a person has not been born yet but is only a developing embryo/fetus that exists only inside the body of its mother connected through an umbilical cord to her bloodstream to usurp her bodily resources, nutrients and energy for itself until her body cannot sustain it anymore and goes into labor to eject the fetus.How can you not see the difference between those two situations? In one situation the person exists as its own entity in the world and in the other situation the person is being created inside a woman's body. One situation involves the use of another person's bodily resources, nutrients and energy and the other situation doesn't."""	0.9978218078613281
6	Daniel_A_Johnson	4	I'm not arguing with your conclusion; I'm saying the argument doesn't make logical sense.You're saying that the high rate of mortality (or self-termination or whatever) of fetuses means that they shouldn't count as people, but the high rate of mortality of newborn babies doesn't mean the same thing.The only way that makes sense is if you're saying that there's a fundamental difference between a fetus and a baby, which you can certainly claim, but then you're using the conclusion of your argument as the premise of your argument.You're not wrong, you're just debating badly.	0.8211891055107117
7	MerrieLee	3	"&gt; You're saying that the high rate of mortality (or self-termination or whatever) of fetuses means that they shouldn't count as peopleNo I am not. I'm saying that since we're already debating at what point during pregnancy does the fetus become \\a person,\\"" then factoring in the rates of survival versus not at each stage of prenatal development is fair. I am not saying that any person who has a slim chance of survival beyond a certain point doesn't count as a person worthy of having their life protected."""	0.3774097263813019
8	Daniel_A_Johnson	9	"But I'm saying, if the point that we're arguing is when a fetus becomes \\a person\\"", how is it fair to say that ***prenatal*** survivability is relevant, but not postnatal? I'm saying what makes one matter but not the other, and your only answer is that they're OBVIOUSLY different.You're asserting a premise that, by itself, goes against the other side of the argument."""	0.932496190071106
9	MerrieLee	2	"&gt; if the point that we're arguing is when a fetus becomes \\a person\\"", how is it fair to say that prenatal survivability is relevant, but not postnatal?Because we're talking about the part where humans go from 0 to 100, not the part afterwards when we're all already at 100. We're talking about the development of human life. When is the process finished and a human exists? At first there is nothing. Then there was a zygote. Then an embryo. Then a fetus. Then finally the development is complete and there is a newborn baby. We're talking about human development: how a human is created. We are not talking about when a human is already created and already exists. We're talking about the creation process."""	0.0063986992463469505
10	Daniel_A_Johnson	6	&gt;Because we're talking about the part where humans go from 0 to 100, not the part afterwards when we're all already at 100.Right, and if MY view (the whole premise of my argument) is that at conception, the moment a sperm hits an egg, it goes from 0, straight to 100, then the likelihood of its survival after that moment would be just as irrelevant to me, right?	0.0026507654692977667
11	MerrieLee	1	Oh okay. Now I understand. That would be a personal religious view, though, not an actual statement of fact about the creation of human beings. But I understand why you bring that up now.	0.25375208258628845
