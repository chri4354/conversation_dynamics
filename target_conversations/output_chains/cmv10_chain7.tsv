"buzzardsgutsman"	"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\"lending\\" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."	NA
"Torin_2"	"1"	"The difference is that once they decide to have the child, they have taken on the obligation to care for the child once it comes into the world. Being pregnant is not necessarily a choice, since a woman can become pregnant unintentionally."
"thoselusciouslips"	"-3"	"The Virgin Mary is the only unintentional pregnancy I can think of off hand, but on a serious note, why is choosing to have sex not an acceptance that they are obligated to any children they may have? Pretty much everyone knows sex can lead to pregnancy."
"z3r0shade"	"8"	"&gt; The Virgin Mary is the only unintentional pregnancy I can think of off handIf the condom breaks and you get pregnant, is that not an unintended pregnancy? This flippant comment, however much in jest it was, is part of the problem. Just because you choose to engage in an action with a known risk of a negative outcome doesn't mean you consent that outcome.A good example is driving. Everyone knows that choosing to drive carries a risk of being in an accident. Yet if someone is hit by a drunk driver we don't tell them that it is their own fault for choosing to drive despite the risks. We don't tell them that they aren't allowed to seek medical care to alleviate the problems or have their car fixed because they should have known better and accepted That they might get into an accident. No, the person who hit them is forced to pay for the damage because we acknowledge that choosing to drive is not consent to be hit by another car."
"ShiningConcepts"	"-4"	"&gt; the condom breaks and you get pregnant, is that not an unintended pregnancy? No it isn't. Any vaginal sex is intended because no BC other than no sex/nonvaginal sex is perfect.Driving is a terrible analogy. There is utility in driving. Sex is purely a hedonistic act that when done in this context is playing chicken with the lives of possible children."
"z3r0shade"	"4"	"&gt; No it isn't. Any vaginal sex is intended because no BC other than no sex/nonvaginal sex is perfect.So you know what the word \\"intended\\" means? I'm not being flippant, that's a serious question. Knowing that no birth control is 100% effective doesn't mean that every woman who chooses to have sex is intending to get pregnant. By definition if they are taking steps to avoid pregnancy then they are not intending to get pregnant. I mean, unless there's some definition of the word \\"intend\\" that I'm unaware of.; There is utility in driving. Sex is purely a hedonistic act that when done in this context is playing chicken with the lives of possible children.You should probably read up on your biology and psychology. Sex has a ton of utility to the continuation of good mental health, relationships, intimacy, and all around wellbeing. Calling it a \\"purely hedonistic act\\" with no utility outside of procreation displays absolute ignorance of biology and history."
"ShiningConcepts"	"-3"	"By that logic so is being anti-rape. Rape is playing chicken with the lives of other people. Recreational sex is playing chicken with the lives of potential children.\\"Rape has a ton of utility to the continuation of good mental health and wellbeing. Calling it a purely hedonistic act with no utility outside of procreation displays absolute ignorance of biology.\\"This is the educated and developed world we are talking about. People are smart enough to not be below the influence of controlling sexuality."
"z3r0shade"	"3"	"Huh what?? I'm so confused and have no idea how you made this jump. Rape has absolutely no utility to the victim whatsoever and is purely harmful. Rape isn't \\"playing chicken with the lives of other people\\" it's a vicious attack on another human being's person and autonomy. ; People are smart enough to not be below the influence of controlling sexuality.What does this even mean?"
"ShiningConcepts"	"-2"	"You said that recreational sex, by bringing sexual pleasure, has legitimate usage in society. So does rape by this logicAnd what I meant was that we live in a civilized society. people are not forced/requires to have sex recreationally"
"z3r0shade"	"1"	"So, I said that recreational sex has legitimate usage in society because it improves self-image, self-esteem, intimacy in relationships, Good mental health, and all around wellbeing. Rape does none of these things.; people are not forced/requires to have sex recreationallyHow is this relevant at all?"
"ShiningConcepts"	"1"	"For sane people, rape does not do those things, but for insane/deranged people it does. Rape may not have any benefit for you but it does to the rapist. You're saying we should be understanding of people who have casual sex because it improves their own self-esteem and mental health; that same logic is applicable to rape because to a rapist it does the same thing. (That's kind of the reason why rape occur); How is this relevant at all?Because it is the difference between this and driving. Driving is needed to get to work and to function in most societies esp. developed Western ones."
"z3r0shade"	"1"	"Rape is generally about power and control. Not self esteem, not mental health. In fact they are usually the result of a lack of both. But all of this is besides the point and not particularly relevant. Whether or not casual sex is beneficial in and of itself has no bearing on the fact that choosing to have sex is not equivalent to choosing to get pregnant. Consent to one is not consent to the other."
"ShiningConcepts"	"1"	"It is consent to the risk of the other so it cannot be treated as wholly unintended and surprising"
"z3r0shade"	"1"	"unintended: not planned or meant.Just because the risk is known to exist does not mean that the negative outcome that can potentially happen is what is *intended*. Neither is anyone claiming it is *surprising* if someone got pregnant despite use of contraceptives. And no one is claiming that they did not consent to the *risk* of getting pregnant. In fact, the *only* claim made is that consenting to the *risk* of something is not equivalent to consenting to it *happening*."
