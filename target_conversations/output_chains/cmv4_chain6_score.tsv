0	t3_5rb7bq	jessebanjo		"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9972221851348877	0.8530923128128052	0.3434939384460449
1	t1_dd5zkve	mrrp	5.0	Self defense is an affirmative defense. To make a claim of self defense, you admit that you are guilty of the elements of the crime, but seek to not be punished due to the circumstances.I do not think that an abortion (let's stick to 1st trimester to keep things simple) needs any sort of self-defense or other affirmative defense to keep it from being a crime.In other words, abortion should be legal simply because it's not illegal, not because we create some sort of exception to a general rule that causing the death of an embryo is criminal behavior.	0.0054893638007342815	0.009582119062542915	0.010195689275860786
2	t1_dd65zn2	jessebanjo		my argument is acting under the assumption that the life-form in the womb is equivalent to a person, and that an abortion is essentially a form of manslaughter. In this case however the killing is justified due to a person's right to protect their own interests and well being in the same way a person can defend themselves from a rapist.	0.5621682405471802	0.5621682405471802	0.34040215611457825
3	t1_dd68ciq	mrrp	5.0	"In my state, using lethal force in self defense generally requires:1. A reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death.2. That you were a reluctant participant.(and two other things which aren't particularly relevant here)Either you do not allow abortion unless the woman was raped (or can prove contraception failed) AND that the pregnancy poses an immediate threat of great bodily harm or death, or you need to explain why a woman can use deadly force against an embryo to \\protect her own interests and well being\\"", but I can't legally kill the guy who just moved in next door and won't turn down his god damn music at night."""	0.8959308862686157	0.6954030394554138	0.40826088190078735
