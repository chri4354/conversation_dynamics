0	t3_64szba	curiouscat145		I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.9912165999412537	0.7279090285301208	0.3905256390571594

3	t1_dg4weg7	Rockmar1	9.0	&gt; There is not a discrete difference between a fetus and an infant.I'd like to change your view back on this one. There definitely is a difference between the two; in fact there are a few differences.The first difference is that a fetus poses a threat to the mother's life - a newborn baby does not. Pregnancy is risky, and complications can lead to the death of the mother. A fetus, by definition, is still inside the mother so the mother will still have to deliver that fetus. That delivery process is dangerous. I feel that people have a right to remove threats to their lives from other people, and in this case I see it as no different just because the fetus happens to be inside the mother.A second difference is that adoption is an option for newborn babies. It is not an option for a fetus. What that means is that if there is an unwanted newborn baby, then the mother has non-lethal options of removing that baby from her life. She can give it up for adoption. However, with a fetus there are no non-lethal options for removing the fetus from her life. Therefore, if the mother does not wish to carry the fetus to term, abortion is the only option available to her.	0.16875872015953064	0.3633655309677124	0.40974873304367065

5	t1_dg5btsv	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		Law of Totality states that the sacrifice of a part for the whole is morally justifiable. Soldiers fighting(part) for the protection of their country and people (whole) and defending themselves from their enemy(self defense threat).Yes, you could say that it is a threat. One of the Laws, the impermissibility of a pre-emptive strike cannot allow you to defend yourself unless they start to try to kill you. At that moment (in this case rushing to you with a knife), they gave up their right to life. Since you have the right to life, you have the right to defend yourself. Killing them, has to be the unintentional result of you trying to incapacitate them.However, the person themselves is not aware that they might or might not kill you, which makes the person innocent. For example, if a person was sleep walking and attempted to beat you up, since they are not aware, they are innocent because they are not aware of their actions. Therefore, they still do have the right to life since they did not intentionally pose as a threat to the mother.	0.07040248811244965	0.3083966374397278	0.3916434645652771
6	t1_dg4tcmf	curiouscat145		âˆ† Really good point actually!There is not a discrete difference between a fetus and an infant. However there is a difference between a fetus and an infant though it is gradual. There have been several studies suggesting that up to a point fetuses do not feel pain and also do not have a central nervous system or conciousness. Therefore I would not consider them to be the same as newborn babies. But thank you for your view point!	0.9528027772903442	0.8407052159309387	0.17657114565372467
7	t1_dg5ckmj	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		You cannot intentionally kill a person or do something bad in order to gain something good in Natural Law.I'm actually pro-choice, but I studied ethics in Natural Law and I can reasonably understand why pro-life people believe that abortion is morally wrong. The potentiality is a good factor in justifying the morality of abortion. To the pro-life person, the fetus is another step of human development, just like the development of an infant to an adult. You are technically taking something away, which is their life, potential happiness, and future potential adulthood. Just like how you kill an infant, you take away the same things, unless that doesn't matter to you either.You have the right to self defense in that scenario. But in this case, you cannot intentionally kill them, you can shoot their knee caps or their hands, but to purposefully aim at the head or heart is wrong. But here's where I draw the line on abortion. If a person was unconscious and is going to physically torture you and they have a 1 in 2000 chance of killing you, Natural Law theorists believe that you should be physically tortured if there's no other way to stop them other than killing the person. I do not agree with that at all.	0.5238036513328552	0.4661391079425812	0.4257189631462097
8	t1_dg5b4mf	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		Well in Natural Law theory, they explain that those who kill others give up their right to life since they are not innocent in respect of having a right to life. On the soldiers, the law of totality explains why a country can send soldiers to battle and the right to self defense which can also justify the deaths of one person.However, those who follow natural law(some prolife people) believe that you cannot intentionally kill someone. There always has to be a main motive, which in these cases, are justice, survival of a country, and self defense.	0.000855598715133965	0.002199411392211914	0.0027812004555016756
9	t1_dg54grz	mutesa1		&gt; Yes, I believe in castle doctrine. I think abortion should be legal whether a fetus is or isn't a human.If the fetus is a human, then it is entitled to the rights and privileges you enjoy, including the right to life.	0.9985123872756958	0.9985123872756958	0.0014085471630096436
10	t1_dg5bba4	Rockmar1	9.0	I'm not familiar with the law of totality so I'm not sure what your second sentence means. But as far as the first sentence goes, abortion falls into that category. It's not just people who kill - it's people who are a threat. So in other words, if a guy is rushing you with a knife you don't have to wait until he stabs you for it to be ok to shoot him.All fetuses pose a threat to the mother's life. Therefore, none of them have a right to life. After they have been born, they no longer pose a threat to the mother and therefore they now have the right to life.	0.5565500259399414	0.6012786030769348	0.3710021376609802
11	t1_dg58b0v	Rockmar1	9.0	The right to life? You mean that right to life that we give to prisoners on death row? Or maybe you mean that right to life that we give to enemy soldiers on the battlefield. Or maybe it's that right to life we give to someone who attacks a cop with a knife.People tend to agree that sometimes it's ok to kill people. Usually these are in cases where the person being killed has a negative effect on others. I just listed three examples. I claim that abortion is another one of these cases. Unwanted babies have a negative effect on the mother and the father. I think that, since there are no other options for removing that negative effect, abortion is perfectly acceptable.	0.002979900687932968	0.11795321851968765	0.31027743220329285
12	t1_dg5c38z	Rockmar1	9.0	&gt; One of the Laws, the impermissibility of a pre-emptive strike cannot allow you to defend yours unless they start to try to kill you.I would claim that the right to defend yourself should then start at the moment of conception since complications could arise at any time.; However, the person themselves is not aware that they might or might not kill you, which makes the person innocent.I think it's interesting that not being aware of their threat is enough of a reason that you feel it's not ok to abort, but the fact that they aren't aware of anything isn't a good enough reason to just abort them. They aren't aware that they are developing or that they will ever be born either. So by aborting them, you really aren't even taking anything away. Sure, you're taking a **potential** thing away, but that isn't the same thing at all.Regardless, I don't see how being aware makes any difference. Let's take your sleepwalking example. In some extreme case where someone was sleepwalking, grabbed a gun, and started shooting at me with it I would think it is perfectly acceptable to kill them. The fact that they aren't aware that they are a threat to me makes them no less of a threat after all.	0.7324180603027344	0.5941487550735474	0.3781527578830719
