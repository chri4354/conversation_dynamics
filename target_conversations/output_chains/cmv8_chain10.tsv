"t3_6ihcuk"	"Daniel_A_Johnson"	NA	"I'm pro-choice, but I also think that the traditional talking points on both sides completely ignore those on the other side. The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\"Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\"But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

"t1_dj776b8"	"sonofaresiii"	"6"	"&gt; Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance.There is a point at which no life exists, right? And there is a point at which a life definitely exists, right?That means without a doubt that there must also be a point at which the non-life becomes a life.It's not a matter of there being *impossible* to decide when life begins, it's that we can't agree on when it is.So I reject your notion that \\"any dividing line is pointless,\\" there absolutely is an answer, we just all need to agree on it.Personally, I've decided that I'm not knowledgeable about the science behind it to decide when a fetus (or group of cells, or whatever) becomes functional enough to become considered a living being worthy of rights, but doctors are. As with most things, I put my trust in those more knowledgeable than I am who use the science involved in measuring something to tell me the answer.And their answer is after one trimester. (or more accurately, that's the point at which we can be sure)Now, you can disagree with me that that's the most accurate time, (you'd be basing your decision off emotion, not science, but that's up to you) but that doesn't mean it's arbitrary or wrong.There is absolutely, 100% a point at which a non-life becomes a life, the issue is not everyone agrees on when that point is. But that doesn't mean it doesn't exist. That just means the question is, should we base it on what knowledgeable doctors who study the science tell us it should be, or an emotional response?I pick the former, and so does the US government."
"t1_dj7jj2b"	"Tsunami36"	"1"	"The egg cell and the sperm cell are both alive. There is no point in the process of human reproduction in which something that isn't alive becomes alive. You are confusing the two definitions of \\"life\\". We are discussing the origin of a human being. The origin of life (ie. abiogenesis) started long before human beings evolved, so it isn't relevant to this discussion."
"t1_dj7k2mw"	"sonofaresiii"	"6"	"&gt; You are confusing the two definitions of \\"life\\".No, you just want me to be. There's absolutely no reason, except by choice, to misinterpret how I'm using \\"life\\" here. I was pretty clear about talking about **a** life, and **a living being**, but for some reason you decided I was talking about whether individual organisms are alive or dead.Even though that interpretation would make absolutely no sense and there's no evidence in my post to suggest I intended it that way, you **chose** to interpret it that way. I'm guessing just so you could start an argument on reddit.; There is no point in the process of human reproduction in which something that isn't alive becomes alive.The word \\"alive\\" appears *nowhere* in my post."
"t1_dj7m2qs"	"Tsunami36"	"1"	"&gt;There is a point at which no life exists, right? And there is a point at which a life definitely exists, right?;That means without a doubt that there must also be a point at which the non-life becomes a life.This is the part I have a problem with. You are referring to things that are alive as \\"non-life\\". The definition of life has multiple meanings but I don't think I've ever seen anyone negate the existence of individuality by referring to it as not life the way you seem to be doing. But I admit that I may have misunderstood your meaning partly because I have seen others try to make the argument that you weren't making (∆). And you still may be wrong that there can be an absolute dividing line between the two, according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. But that's not really relevant to this topic :)"
