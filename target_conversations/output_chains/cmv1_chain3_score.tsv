Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dr3r2cp	Ansuz07	241	"I think the argument breaks down in a couple of places:;A zygote/fetus is a human beingNot everyone agrees with you there. Yes, it has human cells but that doesn't make it a \\human being\\"" anymore than a mole I have removed is a human being. A human being is something that isn't really defined by science - it is a moral or social construct that we put around a person. Heck, a few hundred years ago _newborns_ weren't even named because the odds of them dying were so high; \\""personhood\\"" wasn't really bestowed on them until later in life when odds of survival were higher. If a zygote can't survive outside of the mother then it is fair to come to the conclusion that it isn't a \\""human being\\"" quite yet.You may draw the line at conception, but not everyone does and everyone's line (between conception and birth) may differ since there isn't any real bright line that can be drawn.;It is immoral to kill human beingsYes, but the question here is it immoral to kill a human being by denying it resources you possess? If a homeless man sets up shop in my home, it is moral for me to kick him out even if he might die of exposure on the streets. People all over the world die of diseases every day that are curable, but you and I don't give the money necessary to get them the cures that exist and we don't consider that \\""immoral\\"". If a mother doesn't want to be used as an incubator - using her body against her will - then it may not be immoral for her to deny usage of her body for this purpose.Again, that is a personal line we draw. You can disagree, but others hold the opinion above and don't see it as immoral.Thus, both of the foundation tenants of your argument are very subjective. If I disagree with you on one or both of those items - which many people can and do - then the conclusion doesn't follow for certain."""	0.9754083156585693	0.6495634913444519	0.43529012799263

No one is raking me over the coals for it, so clearly it isn't a black and white issue. We can see people's obligation to help as different based on their role in society and the community.

7	t1_dr4mcqa	KrazyKestral	1	Yes. In my view, a woman should not have to provide her body for use in creating life.

10	t1_dr4o0ey	McDrMuffinMan	1	"Right, but earlier you said its a child when it's a minute from popping out. The distinction you've drawn from fetus/child is very much an arbitrary line especially according to a quick Wikipedia search it's still considered a fetus when it's a minute from being born.;To use a famous example, imagine you wake up with a person medically attached to you, who needs to use your blood/liver/body in order to survive. Are you morally obligated to let them?That's not a fair example at all, one I am in no way responsible for this person attached to me or the creation of this person. A woman has a part in the creation of her child. Secondly if a woman does nothing to remove the child they birth Naturally. That is a human. This would be akin to me saying \\should I have the right to end life support for my friend assuming he's recovering and will be perfectly healthy in 9 mos.\\""That example is entirely intellectually dishonest because it's trying to propose magical hypotheticals to score points. People don't wake up with people attached to them. The overwhelming majority of the time when a woman gets pregnant it's because if an action she undertook willingly. That person she's carrying has rights to. You don't just get to end someone's rights because they inconvenience your life, especially when you are specifically at fault for their creation."""	0.9942877888679504	0.8042570352554321	0.3449440002441406

Additionally, pregnancy and birth are not without labor.Right but that's justifying likely murder over exhaustion it kinda falls apart in comparison. And two people could have made the mistake and two people are responsible for the mistake and neither of them is allowed to end the life of another just because it inconveniences them.;2. You haven't provided any reason why a 4-week old fetus should have the same rights as an 8-month old fetus. As I believe they are inherently different, no argument about the former having personal rights (including a right to life) will be effective to me. A fetus is not a person, so abortion can't be murder. It's surgery.It's not on me to argue on your behalf. I believe even at 4 weeks it's still a human. Developing sure but it's a human life and I think murder is wrong no matter how young. A 5 yr old is still developing into an adult, murder is wrong for the same reason.;As I believe they are inherently different,Right, but facts don't care about your feelings. Does a child in development magically become human at 4.1 weeks and before it isn't? What magical thing happened that makes it a child before and suddenly it becomes one? It sounds like you've arbitrarily drawn a line and you aren't particularly defining where or why that line is there and why.;A fetus is not a person, so abortion can't be murder.Well we can use that logic to argue some interesting things. Firstly, a fetus(child) coming through the birth canal is not a person so we can inject poison into its skull, Vaccum out its brains, and crush its skull because it isn't a human? That isn't murder? Of what if I said \\a toddler isn't an adult so infanticide can't be murder\\"". Or what if I said \\""marooning someone on an desert island where they have no chance to survive is abandonment it isn't murder\\""Much like my examples I gave you, going and getting an abortion takes an action. Killing a toddler is an positive (meaning it's something I have to do) action. Marooning somone on an island is a positive action. Abortion is a positive action. Left untouched that child is born and develops into an adult. You have no right to strip a person of their rights for convenience. You have no right to murder someone because they are a burden to you or society.It doesn't matter how much of an inconvenience they are. The only possible time taking a life is justified is in life or death self defense. With modern medicine, the mother is almost never at risk.;I believe that it is irresponsible to create a new person that you can't take care of, can't afford, and/or don't want, when you have the choice.Totally agree with you, I just don't think I get to murder people because they were irresponsible. Two things can be true at once.

That's a lie and it's intellectually cowardly. Have a standard, go ahead but I want you to hold to it. I want you to think about why you believe what you do and defend it to me if you genuinely think that's whats right.So lets use viability, and since this test works for children it should work for adults too. If you have a failing liver and won't survive without a dialysis machine are you considered viable? What if you need weekly blood transfusions from donors? are you not considered viable? you won't survive without those transfusions which we need other people to donate blood so you mus't be viable? Is murder justified for these people? can we kill them becasue they aren't viable? What if you break your leg hiking in the wilderness of Alaska, are you no longer considered viable considering you will depend on another human being to survive?You used the term \\""viability\\"".

17	t1_dr4rmrd	KrazyKestral	1	Since a fetus becoming a baby is a gradual change, the line between not-person and person has to be put somewhere. 26 weeks is as good as any. Realistically speaking, most ([98.7%](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm)) abortions are performed up to the 20th week, which is well before any 2X week 'personhood' cut off that I have suggested. Also, remember that most late-stage abortions are wanted babies that have to be aborted, usually due to a medical emergency or complication.As far as viability...a fetus cannot break its legs by hiking in Alaska, because it may not even have legs yet. Any and all blood transfusions would come from it's direct connection into its mother's blood supply, and if it needed dialysis it would use its mother's liver, because the mother is the person it's growing on. There is no reason to consider it as an individual with individual rights until it actually becomes an individual. When we have the technology to grow a fetus into a baby from fertilization (or 1 week), it would be much more productive to use it to save wanted babies from medical emergencies, not to grow a baby out of an accidental pregnancy.In any case, I'm not going to be able to convince you that abortions are ok because you believe all fetuses are people and abortion is murder. For the opposite reason, you also won't be able to convince me that abortion is wrong or should be illegal.	0.9909673929214478	0.7358667850494385	0.37087762355804443
