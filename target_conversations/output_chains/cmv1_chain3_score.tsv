Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	NowTimeDothWasteMe	119	Regarding your last point about the value of a fetus v the value of a living child - it can be easy to think like that but when it comes to practical acts almost everyone does. Take this thought experiment: Say you’ve got a building on fire. In one room, you have a test tube zygote. In another room you have a five year old. You only have time to go to one room - do you save the zygote or the five year old? Even the staunchest pro-life people would likely say the five year old. So already we’ve put a value on life. Then how about this. One of the rooms has a bag with five test tube zygotes, the other still has the one five year old. Most people I know would still pick the five year old over five zygotes. Now say we’ve got the technology to entire incubate a fetus in a lab. In one room you have a 32 week old fetus - could probably survive outside the incubator. Do you save it over the five year old? What if it’s five 32 week fetuses. Again, I would say most people would say no. There is an inherent value to being alive that a fetus, though it has the potential for life, doesn’t have. And that changes how we morally can consider abortion.	0.9999521970748901
2	McCoolium	4	"I have two huge issues with your thought experiment.1) Because people will typically choose to save the 5 year old doesn't mean that the fetus is less valuable. I can change your scenario to force you to say that any one life is more or less valuable than another because you are forced to make a choice in a no win scenario. For example, In one room is your mother and in the other is a 5 year old, pick one. Or, in one room there is a 5 year old and in the other room is a 5 year old with Downs syndrome, pick one. I can add more layers to the experiment until I have every possible scenario accounted for which would create a hierarchy of \\value\\"" decided by your choices. Not only is this not an objective way of assigning value, the information gained from the experiment is useless because...... 2) Even if I were to grant you that your thought experiment proves a fetus is of intrinsically lower value compared to a fully developed human, it does not follow that abortion is therefor moral. The choice for abortion isn't \\""I either have to kill this fetus or kill that 5 year old\\"" it's \\""I'm okay with killing this fetus\\"" because of reason X."""	0.9995548129081726
3	NowTimeDothWasteMe	17	But you’re putting abortion in a bubble as well. The vast majority (&gt;70%) of women who have abortions in the US have at least one other child and the most common reason for having an abortion is because pregnancy/a new child would put stress (financial and other) on the already existing family unit. So when the choice becomes - I have to kill this fetus or not have enough money to feed my 5 year old or pay for rent for my 5 year old or have time to help my 5 year old with their homework so they can be educated and escape this cycle of poverty - there is a very different moral obligation. And people talk about adoption, but prenatal care itself can cost anywhere from $9,000-250,000 and it’s very hard to know what end of that because predicting who’s going to have a complicated course is very difficult. If you are already struggling, that can make a huge difference. *edit grammar	0.9989953637123108
4	McCoolium	-2	I consider myself as largely aligning with pro-lifers as I view a fetus, at any stage of development, as human. And because I don't think it's moral under most circumstances to kill another human I can't accept the termination of a fetus as an option for most cases.Of course the way around this is to remove the fetuses status as either alive or human. I fear that not only is this a slippery slope that can lead to some dark stuff, but it's also disgraceful that we can justify what I consider murder. This is made worse to me when the reasons for wanting to abort are as shallow as not having money or worrying about loss of lifestyle.I I know you will disagree with me on my logic. I feel I understand your position, which is maybe more pragmatic. I'm not sure if we could ever change each others minds though.	0.9227087497711182
5	k9centipede	2	Do you view twins as the same person? Where in the splitting process do you feel like they've become two people? When it's two zygote instead of just One? What about conjoined twins? Two heads, but one body? Are they the same person? [Abby and Brittany, for example](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abby_and_Brittany_Hensel)What about someone born with just one head but 'two bodies'? [Myrtle, for example](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myrtle_Corbin) is that two people? What about parasitic twins? How developed do they need to be to count as a person? What if they are literally [just a head?](https://www.snopes.com/photos/medical/maged.asp) Is it immoral to remove them? There's a DNA protein, [Sonic Hedgehog](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_hedgehog) (seriously) that one of the main function is controlling the bilateral symmetry of the body. When it messes up, it results in either the body not developing far enough from the midline and this results in Cyclops. (I couldn't find any pictures that weren't rather disturbing looking. But I'm sure you've seen them on the Discover Channel before.) Or it goes into overdrive and the head starts replicating itself through the midline and you get animals that develop two faces. [Cutest example](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/48574.jpg)There have been cases of this in humans too. Oddly enough the case in India, it's viewed as [One baby with two faces](https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/galleries/x701/48574.jpg) but the case in Australia is viewed as [two babies with one body](http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/conjoined-twins-hope-and-faith-have-distinct-personalities-say-parents-20140519-38ix2.html). Which is correct?	0.4796667695045471
6	McCoolium	1	I'm not sure what you are driving at here.You've given a bunch of examples of flaws within our biology that have caused either mild or extreme birth defects and made no point.What are you trying to convince me of?	0.8962827920913696
7	k9centipede	1	You view twins as flaws in biology?	0.9859082102775574
8	McCoolium	1	"I'm not a biologist, so I'm not sure i can answer that question accurately. But on some level it depend on your metrics now wouldn't it?Twins are correlated to an increase in infant and maternal mortality, twins are more likely to be born prematurely and with that comes a higher chance or post-natal health issues. As well their are other issues, such as breast feeding multiple babies can be incredibly difficult for mothers. Because of this it's not crazy to say that maternal or identical twins aren't supposed to happen which would make them an error or a flaw. But all of this is beside the point because 1) even if they were a \\flaw\\"" they are still human, and 2) you still haven't made any point."""	0.998318612575531
9	k9centipede	1	I'm just asking what your views are on those questions. To see how you categorized them. You stated you viewed someone as human as from the moment of conception. So I wanted to know if that meant, to you, that twins were the same human or separate humans. And I included some follow up questions, to see what your views were on other cases. Why are you avoiding answering them?	0.04659610241651535
10	McCoolium	1	"I'm not avoiding answering them, I'm genuinely confused as to why you are asking such questions because answering them gives you no useful information because I've already stated that I'm anti-abortion in most cases.So to answer your question... Simply put they are all humans and they are all alive until they die naturally. I don't care if you have one face or eight. Twins are of course individual people and so are conjoined twins. Birth defects are no reason to deny an individual their rights as a human.The real question you should be asking is when do support abortion, so here is one example. There are birth defects so severe that the baby will never actually be \\alive\\"", the baby that was born with no brain springs to mind. In these cases I am pro abortion because if we know conclusively that the baby CANNOT survive outside the mother after full gestation, then the risks of pregnancy and the associated psychological stresses for the parents far outweigh any benefit of giving birth to a dead baby."""	0.950126588344574
11	k9centipede	1	Why are you bringing in abortion? I'm asking about your views on what makes someone human and when that begins. So you view Abby and Brittany as 2 humans, but Myrtle as just 1? Why?	0.9998964071273804
12	McCoolium	1	You are so off topic that I have no idea what you are talking about...First if all I didn't say that the two heads and one body = two people; and one head with two bodies = one person.Abby and Brittany are probably two people because they would probably tell you that's how they felt. And you could corroborate their story by talking to each one individually. Myrtle would probably tell you she is one person. The reality is I don't care, and it doesn't matter because they are both at least one person. Because I believe that all humans have the exact same rights, it doesn't matter if they are considered to be one person or eight. The rights are the same. Secondly, I bring up abortion because that's what this CMV is about.	0.1550999879837036
13	k9centipede	1	You stated you believe humans are humans from the moment of conception, and I am asking questions to gain more insight into that view of yours. You've already said you're pro life and don't expect to change that, so I'm not interested in your views on abortion. Just in what makes someone a human/person. Since twins share the same conception history, I am curious how you personally classify the splitting that occurs for twins in your view of humanity. So you don't feel comfortable saying if you think Abby and Brittany are two people or not? Why not? I'm not asking what you think they would say, since there are similar cases where those born in similar ways don't advance beyond infancy so you couldn't ask them for insight. The two examples of babies being born with 2 faces both died early on. Who determines of those babies qualify as one or two humans? Do you view [blighted ovums](http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/blighted-ovum/) as humans? An egg is fertilized but then never actually develops and is just an empty sack.	0.8624333739280701
14	McCoolium	1	With twins, a biologically natural process occurred to create a number of individuals, whether it created them via multiple fertilized eggs or by the zygote splitting is irrelevant to me. I consider Brittany and Abby to be two people. But not only does my opinion on that not matter, it doesn't change the outcome of very many circumstances either way.I can't think if too many scenarios where it would matter whether they are one individual with two personalities or two individuals with one body. Maybe if someone murdered Abby and in doing so Brittany died as well, classifying them as individuals would affect the charges laid (one count of murder vs. two) Aside from that I really think that it is their choice.For the two faced baby, I'm not sure if it is one person or two. Probably one, as stated above it doesn't matter to me because it was at least one and it doesn't need to be more than that. As for blighted ovums in humans, I'm not overly familiar with them. But if I understand correctly they are conceived as if they were a normal human baby and extremely early in gestation they stop developing and are miscarried. In my opinion these are humans that failed to develop into a fetus. I classify them as humans because conception occurred.	0.9997482299804688
15	k9centipede	1	Thank you for answering. And do you feel like Myrtle is one person or two? I know you said before you would just take her word on it, but since you are also pro life I assume you wouldn't take a pregnant woman's word when she declares she and the fetus are just one human at the moment. If you feel personally Myrtle is just one person, Why? You say a blighted ovum should be classified as a human despite the failure to develop, so why would the two clearly separate halves that make up her legs not count individually just because they didn't develop fully? And the Egyptian parasitic twin head? Is that a 2nd person to you? What about when multiple fertilized eggs merge together to form a [chimera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics))? Do they count as a person for each fertilized egg?	0.998349666595459
16	McCoolium	1	I'm going to set a basic criteria down for you that I would use to determine whether someone is an individual or more than one individual so you can stop asking me these questions and we can move onto something productive. I would classify any form of human that forms as the result of conception, natural or otherwise, to be one human. If that individual then, through any method, splits into multiple forms of sentience, or joins with another form of sentience, while maintaining it's own sentience, then you have multiple humans.A human with an extra face or appendages is one human because the extra parts aren't sentient. I understand that those parts may be there because in the womb one fetus absorbed the other. But the absorbed fetus is now dead and is no longer an individual.Further to that, I want to make to make it clear that it does not matter whether you classify someone as 1 person or as multiple people, as both designations carry the same value and rights making the distinction useless.	0.9969720840454102
17	k9centipede	1	Most twin splitting happens within the first week of being fertilized so the mother wouldn't even know she's pregnant so these questions aren't really even relevant to questions about abortions. I was purely curious about the nature of your Humans as Conception belief. And you've answered those questions so thank you. One additional question tho, slightly off topic but relating to one of your responses. You originally said you'd rely on Abby/Brittany and Myrtle to judge what level of personhood they themselves had. Do you respect self-determined labels like that in other classifications, such as Gender?	0.060366060584783554
18	McCoolium	1	"I would take the self determined label that Brittany/Abby or Myrtle would choose for themselves for several reasons. Mainly because there is quite obviously something unique about them, in that being conjoined twins means they are one of a very small number of conjoined twins to have ever existed. This would be a fraction of a percent of humans.Things start to get muddy with me when it comes to how somebody \\feels\\"". A person with multiple personality disorder can feel like they have several independent personalities living within them. I wouldn't say that there actually are several independent people living within that persons body because there is no scientific reason that I am aware of to believe that that's true. And furthermore, there is consensus that multiple personality disorder is a real mental condition. Now this doesn't take away from the fact that suffers of this condition can believe that they are actually multiple people at the same time.How I feel about people's gender identity falls anywhere between, or up to and including both of the examples above. Some people have a truly unique experience, Some have a real mental issue and many are just plain lying about which gender they identify as. So to answer the question directly, it comes down to specific cases as to whether I would personally respect a self determined classification with regard to gender (which I'm confident there are only two) But i respect entirely that my opinion on the matter is useless because I am not a expert in this field. Edit: I am a live and let live kind of guy, if someone wants to call themselves xir and says they are demi gender, I think they are crazy, but it's their life and as long as they aren't hurting anybody I don't really care."""	0.8882405757904053
