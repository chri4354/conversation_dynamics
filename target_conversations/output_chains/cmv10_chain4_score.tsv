0	t3_69us5b	buzzardsgutsman		"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."""	0.9958481788635254	0.742600679397583	0.3838673532009125

3	t1_dh9qfqz	NinjaRobotClone		"The abortion argument places a lot of importance on Roe v Wade and personhood definitions, but imo the more important precedent for discussing this topic is McFall v Shimp.In short, McFall had a fatal illness which required a bone marrow transfusion. Shimp, his cousin, was the only available match as a donor. Shimp refused to donate, McFall sued him, and the court ruled that Shimp could not be forced to donate his bone marrow to McFall even though McFall would die without it.The judge's ruling in that case was that, even though Shimp's position was morally indefensible, he could not be forced to donate bone marrow against his will because BOY that's a slippery slope. Imagine a cousin you barely know suing you for your kidney and the court telling you that you HAD to give one up to them. Or suing you for a piece of your liver because hey, that grows back, you'll be fine! I don't know about you, but a world where that's the standard sounds pretty horrifying to me.In the case of a fetus, which is a parasite by definition and cannot survive without leeching the host's resources and physically occupying the host's body, you should not be mandated to donate the use of your body to sustain that fetus's life, even though it would die without that. If you can't be forced to donate a kidney to a living child, you shouldn't be forced to donate the use of your womb to a developing fetus.Does this leave room for an argument that legitimizes parental neglect? I can see how you might make that case, but going back to legal precedent, the court CAN force you to relinquish economic resources - ie money - and there exists a legal standard of neglect based on professional duty. Medical malpractice suits are based on this, the idea that doctors have a duty to their patients and failure to meet that standard of care qualifies as neglect. I think you could argue that by choosing to be the guardian of a child (your other options being abortion or surrendering the child for adoption), you are taking upon yourself a certain standard of care.Basically, you're not obligated to donate the use of your body to a developing fetus, but you are obligated to a professional standard of care for children you've chosen to be responsible for. I think you can draw a pretty clear line here between \\needs passive use of your organs to survive\\"" and \\""needs active care to thrive\\""."""	0.9868174195289612	0.7641313672065735	0.36384400725364685

7	t1_dha0trp	mvp725		As someone who is socially liberal on damn near every issue except abortion, which I kind of ride the fence on, I thinkthe situation is a little different that Shimp &amp; McFall.The Shimp v McFall case would be more applicable to someone who impregnated by divine intervention and without having had sex (and thus consenting to the potential ramifications). A (somewhat) better comparison, to me, would be as follows: person A has a bad heart. It functions enough to get by, but it severely lowers their quality if life. They can continue on living like this. Person B is a perfect match and, what do you know, was born with a 2nd heart. This heart, despite not being hooked up to your circulatory system, continues to beat and stay healthy. Upon hearing of Person A, you decide you want to donate that heart to them. The doctors assure you it's little risk and will save a life. They remove Person A's heart. They are now fully dependent on you. You wake up mid surgery and decide you no longer want to donate ths heart, thus allowing Person A to die. Can you justify this scenario?	0.9998041987419128	0.7879753708839417	0.3517416715621948
