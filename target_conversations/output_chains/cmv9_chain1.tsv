With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"
"t1_dgauqpp"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"Why does the case seem grey from an ethical standpoint? Even a fully grown adult dependant on your body for survival does not have a right to it. The only reason this seems grey is due to unexamined biases about how we expect the world to work on a human and gender level. We expect pregnant women to give their bodies for 9 months in favor of a baby's life because we expect afterwards a human will arrive and grow up and be a kid and we like humans. From my standpoint, the only position I've heard for anti-choice people is either idiocy in regards to ethics or sexism. I don't think there are other options. Idiocy in light of evidence or clarification is either an unconscious choice, and from there we can analyze what dissonance is causing the refusal, or it is a conscious choice, in which case it is politically motivated. In either case, overt or unconscious sexism surely plays a role."
"t1_dgay1as"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"&gt;Even a fully grown adult dependant on your body for survival does not have a right to it.If you are the reason why the fully grown adult is dependent of your body for survival, I'd absolutely say that you should be obligated to provide it."
"t1_dgayo7p"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"You can say that, but you'd have to justify it."
"t1_dgbbj5u"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"If I need to justify moral beliefs, then you also need to justify yours - why do you think women have a moral right to bodily autonomy at all? Notice, I'm not asking whether they have a legal right. The only way I can think of to justify moral beliefs is to simply appeal to more abstract ethical principles - in my case, that would be the duty to rescue those you have endangered with your own carelessness and/or indifference. The principle is simply compensation and rectification for the danger/damage caused."
"t1_dgbc5k6"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"The right to bodily autonomy is the most basic moral question. Without the right to bodily autonomy there is no argument for your right to live at all."
"t1_dgbce8d"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"Wouldn't it be the other way around? Without the right to life, your right to bodily autonomy could be deprived from you simply by killing you. I guess that means how you'd define bodily autonomy. For it to be a basic moral question, it would have to be incredibly broad."
"t1_dgbct1p"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"No, because bodily autonomy comprises what you do with your body and your right to decide what happens to it. Bodily autonomy is not a complicated or over broad principle. Your right to life is a sub set of your bodily autonomy"
"t1_dgbd6im"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"&gt;Your right to life is a sub set of your bodily autonomyThe right to life cannot be a subset of your bodily autonomy, because I can violate your bodily autonomy without violating your right to life - like forcing you to donate blood or forcing you to get vaccinated. In comparison, I cannot violate your right to life without at the same time violating your bodily autonomy. Therefore, it seems to me that the right to life is the general principle and not the other way around."
"t1_dgbnqff"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"You're correct about all violations of life being violations of bodily autonomy and not all bodily violations being a violation of life, but you've come to the wrong conclusion. That information means that the right of bodily autonomy is more all encompassing. Example: all baseball games is playing sports. Not all sports are baseball. The set of sports contains baseball, not the other way around."
"t1_dgbuqh8"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"&gt;You're correct about all violations of life being violations of bodily autonomy and not all bodily violations being a violation of life, but you've come to the wrong conclusion.Given this, how can you say then that the right to life is a subset of bodily autonomy? The only way the above makes sense is if bodily autonomy is a subset of the right life, where the right to life is the general principle and bodily autonomy is the subsidiary one. If every violation of the right to life violates bodily autonomy, but not the other way around - then by your own admission, the scope of bodily autonomy is not large enough to encompass the right to life. ;That information means that the right of bodily autonomy is more all encompassing. Example: all baseball games is playing sports. Not all sports are baseball. The set of sports contains baseball, not the other way around.This is not a correct classification. The term ''Sport'' is just a general unifying category, not a logical system of elements and components. Baseball is a sport, but baseball is not derived from sport, whereas a hierarchy of rights is a structure where rights are directly derived from other rights."
"t1_dgc0v2p"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"&gt;If every violation of the right to life violates bodily autonomy, but not the other way around - then by your own admission, the scope of bodily autonomy is not large enough to encompass the right to life.I'm confused by this statement. Every A (violation of right to life) is B (violation of bodily autonomy). Not every B is A. B must necessarily be larger than A because it contains all A and the rest of B.;This is not a correct classification.This is telling you how sets work."
"t1_dgc1mb8"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"&gt;Every A (violation of right to life) is B (violation of bodily autonomy). Not every B is A. B must necessarily be larger than A because it contains all A and the rest of B.Violating B must also involve violating everything that B contains. If B contains A, then you cannot violate B without, at the same time, violating A. But as it turns out, you can in fact violate B without violating A. This means that B does not contain A, rather it's the other way around, since you can't violate A without violating B."
"t1_dgc1z5v"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"Box A and B. You can be in Box B without being in Box A, but not the other way around. Every time you are in Box A you are in Box B as well. We can conclude that Box A is inside Box B."
"t1_dgc330k"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"The problem with this account is that it seems to imply that violating your right to life doesn't necessarily violate the right to bodily autonomy. After all, if you take away box A, then I'll still have box B to cover me."
"t1_dgc3dsl"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"Yes, but that's not a problem. That's an aspect of it's nature. Therefore the right to life is a subset of your right to bodily autonomy Edit: scratch that. I thought you were saying something else. That doesn't imply that. You can never be in box A without being in box B. And you can't rearrange the boxes because there positions are analogs for logical constructs. To rearrange the boxes is to rearrange logic.But the real killer is that you flipped contention. First you were arguing that not every violation of the right to life is one of bodily autonomy, and that somehow made it larger. Now you're saying the same of bodily autonomy"

And you can't rearrange the boxes because there positions are analogs for logical constructs. To rearrange the boxes is to rearrange logic.I'm not rearranging your logic at all. I'm just saying that under your proposed structure, removing box A would still leave me with box B, because box A is a subset of B, not the basis of B. ;But the real killer is that you flipped contention. First you were arguing that not every violation of the right to life is one of bodily autonomy, and that somehow made it larger. Now you're saying the same of bodily autonomyYou are confused now. I have explicitly argued that you can't violate the right to life without, at the same time, violating bodily autonomy, but you can violate bodily autonomy without violating the right to life."
"t1_dgchjja"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"Box A in that analogy is the right to life. Being left with box b makes it larger and encompassing. I'm not confused, you don't understand the setd"
"t1_dgcnoo2"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"By your structure, can I take away the right to life without taking away the right to bodily autonomy?"

"t1_dgcsuwo"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"The right to bodily autonomy implies the right to life. It's a consequence of having bodily autonomy."
