0	t3_5rb7bq	jessebanjo		"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\chooses\\"" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."""	0.9972221851348877	0.8530923128128052	0.3434939384460449
1	t1_dd61ldo	uyoos2uyoos2	2.0	"I would argue that self-defense doesn't apply because of the very important concept of premeditation. Most self-defense laws assume that you are using lethal force to combat the threat of imminent harm. However, let's say hypothetically somebody who is incapable of telling a lie sent you a letter and said \\Sometime in the next 9 months I am going to kill and/or rape you\\"". You would not, at that point, make an appointment on your calendar to go to that person's house to go kill them. Now where the parallel works are when the baby threatens immediate injury to your person and a medical decision needs to be made. If you were qualified and capable of diagnosing the medical situation, you would not be liable for the death of even a 5 monther if you were somewhere in the woods and had to somehow self-perform an abortion to save your own life. I'm not taking a position on abortion at all - I think I'm really just addressing the aptness of your analogy to the conversation."""	0.0004779426963068545	0.1514788717031479	0.34678858518600464
2	t1_dd93rlu	on_my_lunch_break	7.0	At a minimum, childbirth requires someone to take weeks off work and involves a major medical procedure, which is life threatening even for healthy pregnancies. That, to me, is objectively harmful.	0.8602274656295776	0.8602274656295776	0.12116900086402893
3	t1_dd8q574	uyoos2uyoos2	2.0	"&gt; is that the burden of pregnancy is actual and ongoing, not hypothetically going to occur So in terms of the law there are two things I will point out. The term \\burden\\"" isn't necessarily the same as the term \\""harm\\"". While I have never been pregnant (or even had period cramps) I think the argument for pregnancy pain is that it's somewhere above \\""discomfort\\"" and somewhere below \\""harm\\"". Having said this the operative definition of justified retaliation is doing so under undue harm. The pain and burden experienced during presidency not being undue, given the circumstances. I will also speak to the \\""hypothetically going to occur\\"" argument. The law recognizes, and I think for good reason, that the undue stress inflicted on a person from a death threat. In this sense, the stress may not be physical but it is ongoing in much the same way as a pregnancy is. However neither is enough to allow for lethal force."""	0.9959346652030945	0.8207971453666687	0.3184147775173187
