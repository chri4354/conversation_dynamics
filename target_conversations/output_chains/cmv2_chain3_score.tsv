0	t3_64szba	curiouscat145		I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.9912165999412537	0.7279090285301208	0.3905256390571594

I think he implied emotional/mental aspects, not genetic.	0.9403634667396545	0.9403634667396545	0.018795311450958252

These are unintentional pregnancies. Not an unpardonable sin that will doom the impregnated to a fate worse than death.;I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income.I agree.;I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting.I agree. There are better reasons, like the life of the mother.;I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control.Why not? Not efficient enough for you?; I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.Then you argue that these people should never have children because you argue their DNA is not capable of overcoming bad circumstances.Contrarily, I think every genetic profile is equally likely of success given the right cultural attitude.	0.9760543704032898	0.6015108227729797	0.4669606685638428
