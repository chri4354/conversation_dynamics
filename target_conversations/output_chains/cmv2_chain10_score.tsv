0	t3_64szba	curiouscat145		I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.9912165999412537	0.7279090285301208	0.3905256390571594
1	t1_dg542yh	Tippydaug		Many people back this up by saying the baby isn't really alive solely because it can't survive outside of the womb. However, by the age of only 6 weeks, a baby typically has a heartbeat.Life: the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the response to stimuli or adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.To begin in simplest terms, in abortion videos, the baby clearly responds to stimuli. The baby also grows and develops its metabolism. While it can't reproduce, neither can babies until a certain age, so that isn't quite comparable.However, you may not accept that as a living being, which is fine. That leads to my biggest argument.You stated that abortion is a helpful option to people who can't afford the child and would be sent into poverty. While I do agree keeping the child themselves would be an issue, I feel there are many options they could do before abortion. The baby could be put up for adoption or taken care of by a family member.If a women were to abort a baby herself, no matter how early on, she would be charged for murder (I know because a friend of my mother was charged for the very thing), yet doctors can do it and it is no longer murder.There are many gaps within the logic of abortion and, while I do understand why some believe it's a good option, I strongly disagree.	0.9554368257522583	0.629632830619812	0.42976754903793335
