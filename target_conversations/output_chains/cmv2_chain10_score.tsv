0	curiouscat145	43	I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.8889859914779663
1	Hq3473	18	How do you feel about killing-off new born babies?Would not all the same reasons you listed (poverty, social reasons, economic reasons) - equally apply?	0.9996214509010315
2	curiouscat145	10	âˆ† Really good point actually!There is not a discrete difference between a fetus and an infant. However there is a difference between a fetus and an infant though it is gradual. There have been several studies suggesting that up to a point fetuses do not feel pain and also do not have a central nervous system or conciousness. Therefore I would not consider them to be the same as newborn babies. But thank you for your view point!	0.33615365624427795
3	Hq3473	4	Thanks for the delta!also, you say:;here have been several studies suggesting that **up to a point** fetuses ...So you think there is a point AFTER which abortions can be banned?If so, you should edit your OP to specify that, because it now appear that you are in favor of ALL abortions.	0.4085216522216797
4	shockwaveJB	1	5 weeks is when nervous system develops... Might be a good start	0.019235000014305115
5	Freevoulous	1	to early, at this point said nervous system is below the level of an insect, in terms of complexity.	0.9990527033805847
6	shockwaveJB	1	Can insects feel pain? I actually don't know	0.6322357654571533
7	Freevoulous	1	no, they do not. Some higher insects can detect damage to themselves, but thats about it.	2.43578488152707e-05
8	shockwaveJB	1	At what point do you think abortions should be banned and why. Pretty sure you don't think it is until the kid is born because in the last month they are pretty high functioning	0.49101722240448
9	Freevoulous	1	Abortions should be legal to a point where the fetus is developed enough to be removed through a cesarian section and live. Essentially, a woman should have a right to remove the fetus out of her at any moment, though once it is possible to extract it ALIVE, it should be the doctor's duty to do so, and it should override the woman's plea for abortion.At this point, the child extracted so should become a ward of the state, and not legally a child of its biological mother.	0.9999948740005493
10	shockwaveJB	2	Define ALIVE	
11	Freevoulous	1	capable of surviving by itself , with chances of survival over 50%.Im no expert but I thing early 7th month of pregnancy is the absolute earliest when this is probable.	0.569115400314331
