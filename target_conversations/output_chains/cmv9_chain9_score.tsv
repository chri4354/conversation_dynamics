With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it.

1	Mitoza	6	Why does the case seem grey from an ethical standpoint? Even a fully grown adult dependant on your body for survival does not have a right to it. The only reason this seems grey is due to unexamined biases about how we expect the world to work on a human and gender level. We expect pregnant women to give their bodies for 9 months in favor of a baby's life because we expect afterwards a human will arrive and grow up and be a kid and we like humans. From my standpoint, the only position I've heard for anti-choice people is either idiocy in regards to ethics or sexism. I don't think there are other options. Idiocy in light of evidence or clarification is either an unconscious choice, and from there we can analyze what dissonance is causing the refusal, or it is a conscious choice, in which case it is politically motivated. In either case, overt or unconscious sexism surely plays a role.	0.9953650832176208
2	MnemonicFitness	3	&gt;Even a fully grown adult dependant on your body for survival does not have a right to it.If you are the reason why the fully grown adult is dependent of your body for survival, I'd absolutely say that you should be obligated to provide it.	0.9973267316818237
3	Mitoza	0	You can say that, but you'd have to justify it.	0.014835265465080738
4	krimin_killr21	2	If you take an action that leads to a human being being dependent on you for their survival, through no fault of their own but rather through yours, you are obligated to assist their survival, even at cost to yourself.	0.9906768798828125
5	Mitoza	1	That's just the above assertion in longer form. You need to justify it.	0.07421881705522537
6	krimin_killr21	3	That would be like asking me to justify a preference for chocolate over vanilla. It's my moral belief. I don't need to justify it any further. And to add to that, there are many millions of people who hold the same opinion.	0.5692381858825684
7	Mitoza	3	Moral beliefs need justification, they aren't just opinions. The idea that many people agree doesn't make you right. If 51% of people believed killing the other 49% was morally justified, it would not make them morally correct	0.011827507056295872
8	krimin_killr21	2	&gt;Moral beliefs need justification, they aren't just opinions.I completely disagree with that. And I don't think logically you could prove otherwise.While I'd be happy to engage in the meta-ethical debate about whether moral statements are facts (and if they are, what standard defined their truth value), that's not the present debate.You're saying (correct me if I'm wrong) that if I think a capricious third trimester abortion is tantamount to the murder of a new born that I must be sexist because there's no other basis upon which I could make that judgement. I'm saying that the basis upon which I say that that is wrong is that you have to be accountable for the support of those who depend on you if you made them so dependant by your own wrecklessness. You are free to say that I am unjustified in this belief, but I still win the point, because I have demonstrated that I am against capricious third trimester abortions on a basis other than sexism, even if that basis is, in your opinion, unjustified.	0.3121626079082489
9	Mitoza	2	Even if you're insisting on the notion that moral beliefs are just opinions that can't be wrong, you still have a stake in justifying why it is that you believe those things. You would be suspicious of my basis if I declared it good to steal from you specifically. What you say you position is and what it is informed by are two distinct things.	0.9757994413375854
10	krimin_killr21	2	I agree with you. But at some point you get to something that can't be further justified. I suppose though I could demonstrate it by comparison.Suppose that I give a child an incurable liver disease for which I was the only known viable donor. Knowing that I can donate some of my liver and still survive, am I obligated morally to give that child part of my liver?	0.7767242789268494
11	Mitoza	1	You had no right to give the child the liver disease, which makes the case not analogous.	0.051949627697467804
12	krimin_killr21	1	Let's clear something up real quick. Would you be opposed to a prohibition against third trimester abortions only?	0.03455023840069771
13	aboy5643	2	That's the ethical position, yes. Absolutely no one is advocating for abortions after the point of viability (amazing that that is what the Supreme Court ruled, isn't it?) unless *it endangers the life of the mother which is also a violation of bodily autonomy*. Forcing someone to risk their life to save another is not ethically defensible by any coherent moral system that I've heard of. It's ethically commendable to do that but what duty would there be to do that?	0.998062789440155
14	krimin_killr21	1	You'd be very surprised. I've had debates before with those who insisted that abortion should be permitted up until expulsion of the fetish during labour was complete, and that I was sexist for thinking otherwise. I'm talking day before delivery abortions being permissible. It was me against about a dozen people all who advocated that position. I wouldn't be surprised if /u/Mitoza actually did support that position.A foetus prior to the third trimester is not a human being and does not have moral interests sufficient to overcome the mother's. Abortions before that point should be permissible in pretty much all cases.A third trimester abortion should only be permissible if there's a threat to life. That's basically my position.	0.9530550837516785
15	aboy5643	2	And that's the position of every person who has earnestly examined the ethical questions of abortion. That is the point being made in this thread: a logical set of ethical rules could only lead someone to be pro-choice. The pro-life position as it exists in the US (restricting access to abortion pre-viability) does not stand up to ethical scrutiny.I would be shocked if Mitoza supported that position because they are using actual arguments rooted in philosophy. Again, no one who is arguing for abortion from a philosophical position would be able to form a cohesive argument for post-viability abortions without proving fetuses do not possess personhood (and we can't do that). That is why the law and pro-choice advocates (legitimate voices in the conversation, not random people with no understanding of the underlying rationale for the law) argue for exactly the position you state. I'm curious how you consider that position to be pro-life at all because it doesn't represent many, if any, significant voices in the pro-life camp, and it absolutely represents the position of the vast majority of the pro-choice argument.	0.5811154842376709
16	krimin_killr21	1	For one I don't consider my position Pro-life, just more pro-life then the most pro-choice position possible.The OP of this content chain said:;Even a fully grown adult dependant on your body for your survival does not have a right to it./u/Mitoza has implied that he believes this hold true even for a person put in that position through the person being depended upon's own fault. I don't see how he could hold any other position than the one I'm suggesting he does.	0.9826787114143372
17	aboy5643	2	"The point being made there is that personhood of the fetus is absolutely irrelevant because *no one* has a right to infringe on your right to bodily autonomy. Post-viability abortions aren't defensible from the position of bodily autonomy because after viability, removing someone from using your body is technically just giving birth. \\Aborting\\"" a pregnancy at that point is then an active choice to end a life and not \\""pulling the cord out\\"" so to speak.In the violinist analogy, a pre-viability abortion would be removing whatever support system connects you and the dying violinist. You are not actively taking a life. In the same analogy, a post-viability abortion would be like cutting the violinist's throat even when he theoretically no longer needed your body to survive. I think you may have read too far into that statement. Most people will make that distinction so as to preempt any nonsense arguments about personhood; personhood is irrelevant in this ethical argument for abortion but personhood is often the most common disagreement in the public debate over abortion.EDIT: I feel it's also important to make sure we're all starting from a common place. \\""A Defense of Abortion\\"" by Judith Jarvis Thompson is widely considered to be the most poignant philosophical examination of abortion. This thread has largely drawn on those themes perhaps without providing the necessary context. A quick google search of the title should get you to that essay in full. Fair warning, it's a little lengthy. But it's a philosophical thesis, not an emotional plea, so it necessitates some length."""	0.9726410508155823
