"t1_dghuf83"	"IceWaves"	"4"	"&gt;A fetus 5 months into the pregnancy, for example, if born could very well live and grow into an adult. Factually inaccurate. The viability rate at 20 weeks is less than 1%. And if it lives, it will be with moderate to severe health problems. Viability increases 2-3% for every remaining week it's in the womb.I had an abortion. My fetus decided to implant itself into my fallopian tube. If I hadn't have removed it, it would have exploded and I would have died.My sister also had an abortion. She has a genetic disease that would make carrying a child to term unimaginably painful for her. She had an IUD but got pregnant with it anyhow."
"t1_dghvkt9"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"Thank you for sharing your story. I agree that you should have been able to get an abortion as you were in a clear danger. I was born 6 months into the pregnancy (not too far from 5) and turned out fine... besides, the number 5 was arbitrary and simply used to make a point. By the way, I am not advocating banning abortion. I am simply saying that we should educate teenage women on birth control and give advice to women instead of saying that abortion is always the solution. What I am saying, though, is that the act of aborting a baby is immoral (in most cases, not yours for example) and should be avoided."

Using the argument that you experienced something so it's good for everyone is really off the mark."
