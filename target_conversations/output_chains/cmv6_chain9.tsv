"SchiferlED"	"16"	"&gt;The fetus is a human fetus and should therefore have the right of every other human not to be murdered; everyone should have the opportunity to live.It has the right to live, but not the right to be inside of the woman when she doesn't want it inside her. If the natural result of removing it from her body is the death of the fetus, then that is just an unfortunate circumstance, not murder. \\"Right to live\\" does not mean \\"everything possible must be done to keep it alive, or else it's murder\\".;Many will say that a fetus is not human, yet I would argue that it is because of its genetic makeup. Most people would characterize \\"being human\\" as exiting the vagina; I disagree. Being human, giraffe, ape, etc., is dependent on one's genetic makeup rather than what it comes out of.Human genetics is not the issue here. If anything \\"personhood\\" is the issue, although that still does not get around my first point. The skin on your back is \\"human\\" but you don't bat an eye at someone who scratches their back and kills human cells. That's because those cells alone are not a \\"person\\". Many argue that the fetus is not developed enough to be a \\"person\\" yet, so there is no issue with an abortion."
"Reason_is_Key"	"0"	"The woman, unless in cases of rape, has made the choice to have unprotected sex, which she knew could potentially lead to the development of human life. Therefore, the baby has the right to be inside of the mother.Killing a skin cell, in my view, is not immoral as it does not have the potential to become human life. A fetus, on the other hand, does."
"IceWaves"	"4"	"&gt;has made the choice to have unprotected sexBirth control used *perfectly* has a failure rate of 1% per year. That means that if there are 10 million women having sex in the US that are using birth control, 100,000 will get pregnant despite using birth control perfectly. Per year. This has happened to two friends of mine and my sister.For those women, who didn't want children and were actively taking precautions, would you force babies on them or put them in jail?"
"Reason_is_Key"	"1"	"No, I never mentioned punitive actions, such as jail. I am merely saying that we should not offer abortion as the new \\"standard\\" when it comes to unplanned pregnancies and teach women that there are other options."
"kaijyuu"	"3"	"is this being offered as a \\"standard\\" by anyone, or simply a choice among a few?what options do you feel women have not been informed of, regarding a potential unplanned pregnancy?"
"Reason_is_Key"	"0"	"What I mean is that we shouldn't simply tell women, \\"go have as much unsafe sex as you want because you can get an abortion later\\". We should, instead, teach proper methods of safe sex, including condom and birth control usage. We should also include adoption more prevalently among the choices."
"IceWaves"	"1"	"You failed to address my point about birth control failure."
"Reason_is_Key"	"1"	"That's a risk that people should expect to take when engaging in intercourse. Nobody is forcing people to have sex; they choose to do so, whether they wear a condom or not"
"SocialJusticeWizard_"	"2"	"That's an unrealistic attitude. Sex is a natural part of the human condition."
