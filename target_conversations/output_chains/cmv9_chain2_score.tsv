0	t3_65jy88	Milkshaketurtle79		I'm pro choice. I don't support abortion, but I support a woman's right to do as she pleases with her body. It's not my place to decide. With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it.

2	t1_dgaybw5	moonflower	51.0	Not necessarily - if men could also get pregnant, the anti-abortionists could also be against men having abortions. It's not their fault that only women can get pregnant.	0.5286522507667542	0.5286522507667542	0.4707218408584595

4	t1_dgb31az	moonflower	51.0	No, it's not moot, because it shows that being against the killing of foetuses is not inherently sexist.	0.9995993971824646	0.9995993971824646	0.0
5	t1_dgb5om8	berrieh	20.0	It does not. It shows that biology makes this a concern irrelevant to men, but that doesn't stop it from being inherently sexist.	0.9841699600219727	0.9841699600219727	0.0
6	t1_dgba7qe	moonflower	51.0	No, it's not *inherently* sexist - if modern medical technology enabled a man to grow or transplant a uterus and to somehow sustain a surrogate pregnancy, there might be some anti-abortionists who would be against *him* having an abortion - because they are against the killing of foetuses, *not* because they are against women doing what they want.	0.9994779229164124	0.9994779229164124	0.0

13	t1_dgca9x5	berrieh	20.0	Because the outcomes of such legislation are inherently sexist since men do not have to deal with this issue biologically. I explained this in my detailed answer to OP. As OP hasn't responded to me at all or to anyone in ages, I'm out, but you're not addressing my core points at all.
