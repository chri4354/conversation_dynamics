"SchiferlED"	"16"	"&gt;The fetus is a human fetus and should therefore have the right of every other human not to be murdered; everyone should have the opportunity to live.It has the right to live, but not the right to be inside of the woman when she doesn't want it inside her. If the natural result of removing it from her body is the death of the fetus, then that is just an unfortunate circumstance, not murder. \\"Right to live\\" does not mean \\"everything possible must be done to keep it alive, or else it's murder\\".;Many will say that a fetus is not human, yet I would argue that it is because of its genetic makeup. Most people would characterize \\"being human\\" as exiting the vagina; I disagree. Being human, giraffe, ape, etc., is dependent on one's genetic makeup rather than what it comes out of.Human genetics is not the issue here. If anything \\"personhood\\" is the issue, although that still does not get around my first point. The skin on your back is \\"human\\" but you don't bat an eye at someone who scratches their back and kills human cells. That's because those cells alone are not a \\"person\\". Many argue that the fetus is not developed enough to be a \\"person\\" yet, so there is no issue with an abortion."
"Reason_is_Key"	"0"	"The woman, unless in cases of rape, has made the choice to have unprotected sex, which she knew could potentially lead to the development of human life. Therefore, the baby has the right to be inside of the mother.Killing a skin cell, in my view, is not immoral as it does not have the potential to become human life. A fetus, on the other hand, does."
"IceWaves"	"4"	"&gt;has made the choice to have unprotected sexBirth control used *perfectly* has a failure rate of 1% per year. That means that if there are 10 million women having sex in the US that are using birth control, 100,000 will get pregnant despite using birth control perfectly. Per year. This has happened to two friends of mine and my sister.For those women, who didn't want children and were actively taking precautions, would you force babies on them or put them in jail?"
"Reason_is_Key"	"1"	"No, I never mentioned punitive actions, such as jail. I am merely saying that we should not offer abortion as the new \\"standard\\" when it comes to unplanned pregnancies and teach women that there are other options."
"kaijyuu"	"3"	"is this being offered as a \\"standard\\" by anyone, or simply a choice among a few?what options do you feel women have not been informed of, regarding a potential unplanned pregnancy?"
"Reason_is_Key"	"0"	"What I mean is that we shouldn't simply tell women, \\"go have as much unsafe sex as you want because you can get an abortion later\\". We should, instead, teach proper methods of safe sex, including condom and birth control usage. We should also include adoption more prevalently among the choices."
"kaijyuu"	"5"	"...who tells women that?we do teach safe sex (in the us, i'm not sure if you're somewhere else) - including both of those things. i don't know where you're living that adoption is not a very commonly known option for unplanned pregnancies.planned parenthood presents [3 main options](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/pregnancy/pregnant-now-what) right up front, for instance.according to research, women get abortions [for a variety of reasons](http://www.webmd.com/women/tc/abortion-reasons-women-choose-abortion) - in the reasons listed at that link, i will assume from what i've read in this post that you are at least cautiously all right with the last three reasons.of the first three, the first one is contraceptive failure - so women are using condoms/birth control, but they've failed. obviously they know *about* them to use them.the second seems to be the one you might be most concerned about, but if a woman is already unable to support a child (financially, say) then they might very well be unable to support *themselves* during said pregnancy, even if they wanted to give the child up at the end.the third is difficult because it's vague, but even if those few women are treating abortion like birth control (which is ridiculous considering cost and the effect on your body?), we are already performing the majority abortions for women for understandable, justifiable reasons."
"Reason_is_Key"	"1"	"Well said; I hadn't realized that most abortions were in the first and second categories. Thanks for that comment !delta"
