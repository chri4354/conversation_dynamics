"t3_5shhx3"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I'm making this CMV because I've noticed that my views on abortion don't really line up with either of the two main viewpoints on it (although they're much closer to a pro-choice viewpoint than a pro-life one). This isn't so much one specific view as it is a collection of related views regarding abortion.I'll specifically list the things that I believe and the things that I don't believe. I think it's good to address both sides because we live in a world where a simple sentence like \\"I support gun rights\\" has people immediately jumping to conclusions about your views on everything from race relations and gay marriage to economic standpoints and foreign policy. Addressing both sides helps to avoid people reaching incorrect conclusions.Important note: For the purposes of this discussion I am writing this with the assumption in mind that a fetus at any point in development is equivalent to a human life. I **do not** believe this and I will explain my reasons for making this assumption in the \\"Things I don't believe\\" section.Also, I am from the U.S.A. and I will be writing this with specific regards to the United States. When I say 'government', 'society', etc. I mean the U.S. government or U.S. society.**Things that I believe***View*: Abortions help society.*Reasoning*: There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies. For starters, every human who is born takes up a lot of resources, and produces a lot of pollution. The average American is responsible for roughly 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita)). Essentially, humans are bad for the environment so less humans is a good thing if we consider climate change to be important.Additionally, unwanted babies are more likely to grow up in bad situations (since they were unwanted), and are more likely to become criminals detrimental to society, or if not criminals then people on welfare which is also detrimental to society. Now yes, it is possible that some aborted baby would have grown up to be the next Einstein. But since it is more likely that they will end up being detrimental to society, I see no reason why we should assume that the less likely of two outcomes will happen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Women of any age, citizenship status, etc. should be able to get an abortion from any abortion clinic for free, no questions asked.*Reasoning*: In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 ([source](https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2014/06/much-abortion-cost-draft-theresas/)). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. If you oppose a doctor simply informing their patient of the facts, then you oppose spreading knowledge and have no place in any sort of philosophical discussion. If you still do not like the fact that the woman may be more likely to choose abortion when they are more aware of the facts, then maybe you should rethink your position on the matter because when people gain knowledge on the subject they become more likely to disagree with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.*Reasoning*: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.Also not that this is fundamentally different from things such as breastfeeding or a mother simply providing food for her child. Breast milk serves no purpose to the mother, and the nutrients stored in food do not belong to anyone until they consume that food. In this way, a fetus in the womb truly does steal nutrients from the mother. A baby does not steal nutrients from the mother, but rather uses nutrients that were either useless to the mother (breastmilk), or provided by the mother as a gift and therefore never the mother's in the first place.----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.*Reasoning*: This point will probably cause the most controversy. Many people will disagree with this because late in the pregnancy, the fetus would be able to survive on its own if it were surgically removed from the woman in the proper manner. However, I believe that just because it would be able to survive on its own does not change the fact that it is still essentially a parasite and the woman still deserves the right to remove that parasite from her body. The fetus, while in the womb, is still feeding off the nutrients of the mother (regardless of whether or not it could survive outside the womb), and therere should be treated as a parasite.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Things that I do not believe***View*: Women should be forced to have abortions.*Reasoning*: This one is obvious but it must be stated, I do not believe that any woman, for any reason, should EVER be forced into having an abortion. Encouraging them is fine, informing them is fine, forcing them is not.--------------------------------------*View*: A fetus's life is equivalent to a human life*Reasoning*: As I mentioned earlier, I want this discussion to be had with the assumption in mind that fetus's are equivalent to human lives. However, I do not believe this is true. The reason I wish for this to be the assumption is that pro-lifers tend to get hung up on this which I know will lead to a meaningless discussion because I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were **uneqivocally proven** that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to \\"I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way.\\"----------------------------------*View*: All killing is bad*Reasoning*: There are many forms of killing that are generally considered acceptable. Soldiers kill other soldiers in wartime, people are allowed to kill in self-defense, and criminals are executed due to their crimes. All of these are perfectly legal forms of killing, and though some are controversial most would agree that at least one of the three is justified. I believe that abortion is another one of these types of killing. This is also why I don't care whether the fetus is a human or not - I view it as a legally and morally justified form of killing.While I am interested in having my view changed, I am also interested in simply having a discussion on the topic.

"t1_ddfpn7q"	"TheNet_"	NA	"That's ridiculous. I don't think either of us has any empirical evidence to show, so it's just my life experience vs your life experience, but I feel obliged to say that people are not nearly as delicate as your scenarios require."
"t1_ddf59qy"	"Kwinnox"	"8"	"I hope you don't mind if I limit myself to one of your arguments, at least for the time being. ;*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).;*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. [redacted for brevity]Are you proposing that the possibility of abortion is mentioned early on in every pregnancy?"
"t1_ddf6klk"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I don't mind at all. And yes, that's pretty much exactly what I'm proposing. That doctors should be required to inform all of their pregnant patients about the option of abortion."
"t1_ddf831i"	"Kwinnox"	"8"	"Alright! Figured I'd make sure I understood that properly before voicing my disagreement with that. (*Having typed this out, my comment is a little more long winded than intended. The following paragraph and the closing paragraph make my point; the rest of the body is just supporting anecdotes, really*)There are countless of instances in which it's not only entirely unnecessary to inform the mother of the possibility of abortion, but straight up damaging as well. For one example, let's assume we're dealing with a woman who actually wants to have a baby. Presenting them with the information regarding an abortion not only useless, but offensive. It's not hard to imagine that information on abortion isn't going to be well-received by an expecting mother. Particular circumstances surrounding their pregnancy may make it worse, still. Suppose the woman has been trying to get pregnant for years and it finally happened for her. Informing her of the possibility of abortion is a smack in the face. It's easy to imagine the woman wanting a different doctor after that. You can tweak that example in many different ways to end up with a situation where the mentioning of abortion is useless at best, but more often than not detrimental. Now, that might well be justified by a particular end... but does the mere virtue of \\"having mentioned it\\" justify the giving of that information? I severely doubt that. Of course, there are also countless of examples where the mentioning of abortion has its merits and I'm not trying to discount that. There ought to be some discrimination, however, between cases where abortion is decidedly off the table and cases where it might be a desirable course of action. I really do believe we should leave to the tact of the medical professionals to determine when which is the case. A blanket provision of that information is going to cause unnecessary friction between a good amount of pregnant women and their doctors."
"t1_ddftso9"	"Kwinnox"	"8"	"All you have to grant me is that there are situations where abortion is off the table as a choice by the mother-to-be. Some people actually want kids. Even if you reject the notion that people might take offence to a doctor's mentioning of the possibility of abortion (which as I mention elsewhere is simply a failure to put yourself in another person's shoes), you're still left with the sheer uselessness of it in some situations. Suppose, for instance, that a woman had an emotionally taxing miscarriage earlier in life. Afterwards she had the greatest difficulty getting pregnant again, but finally it worked. She goes to the doctor who, in their first ever encounter, matter-of-factly states: \\"Oh, by the way, you can always abort!\\" That'd be so far out of left field as to be abrasive. I'm not even saying many people would react this way; I'm merely calling into question the utility and desirability of providing *all* women with information that is, to some extent, useless and upsetting."
