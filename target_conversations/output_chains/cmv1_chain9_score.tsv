Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dr76nmi	long-lankin		I disagree with pretty much everything you have to say I'm afraid. It may look like a small baby, but a foetus at 12 weeks is vastly different physiologically than an actual human infant. Its brain is so underdeveloped that it could be considered brain dead, and it's only after 20 weeks that it begins to have any significant activity at all. It is a potential person, but it is not a person yet. Having a body is not the same thing as having a right to bodily autonomy - you have to have personhood first. Personhood isn't genetic - a fertilised embryo would not be considered by anyone to be anywhere near equivalent to an actual baby. There are physiological milestones instead that must be reached, hence why most agree on a limit of 24 weeks for abortion in most cases. Personhood also has a moral component, requiring the ability to participate to a degree, which is why consciousness, and the ability to learn and interact with the world, as even a baby does, is so essential. Please read what Warren has to say on the subject - at best I can only crudely paraphrase her words and ideas.I don't really agree with the analogy to pregnancy you present at all. For one, I don't regard a foetus and a baby as being in any way morally equivalent, as one possesses personhood while the other does not. Secondly, the nature of the obligation and care required is vast. Caring for a baby for a few hours is in no way the same as surrendering the use of your body for nine months. A better analogy, which actually focuses on bodily autonomy, which you seem to wildly misinterpret, would be the violinist analogy of Thomson.	0.9992297887802124	0.8523773550987244	0.3366311490535736
2	t1_dr7ksq6	qdxv		A twelve week foetus moves and responds to stimuli, it certainly isn't brain dead.This term 'personhood' is problematic. Your criteria for obtaining personhood (participate, learn, interact) excludes people in comas. By losing personhood you then lose the right to body autonomy? Who on Earth makes up these rules?The violin analogy isn't useful because it is a non-consensual scenario, most pregnancies do not result from rape. Pregnancy also does not require you to stay in a hospital bed immobilised for nine months, as in the analogy.	0.9828066825866699	0.5691729784011841	0.4913952350616455

4	t1_dr4e6l5	long-lankin		A few things - firstly it seems quite absurd to claim you're pro-choice when the apparent conclusion of your beliefs is that abortion is murder. If you find it to be so immoral then I can't really understand how you could support it at all.Secondly, I suggest you look at the work of Mary Anne Warren, among others, who've argued about the justification of abortion through the lack of a foetus' personhood. You seem to have sidestepped their arguments and the issue of personhood on general without considering it. A foetus is not a person, but it gets closer to acquiring such personhood the closer it comes to term. After certain milestones in its development, abortion may be considered immoral - hence why abortion after 24 weeks is restricted, with the only exceptions being if the foetus isn't viable or there's a risk to the mother's life. Before that point the moral worth of the foetus may be outweighed by other considerations - bodily autonomy for instance, as outlined by Judith Jarvis Thomson. Abortions up to 20 weeks occur very rarely, and usually because women haven't had access to it beforehand, or because there is an abnormality with the foetus. You might consider aborting for such reasons to be immoral, but many would consider knowingly inflicting a life of suffering on a child to be a far worse crime. 98% of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks when it is absurd to consider a foetus as anything remotely close to a human life. If there is a moral cost it is so low as to be insignificant, and easily outweighed by the moral right to bodily autonomy etc. Contrary to what you seem to believe, the development of the foetus is actually hugely important to the abortion debate.	0.9860678911209106	0.6931031346321106	0.4351014792919159
5	t1_dr4nf6h	qdxv		&gt; 12 weeks when it is absurd to consider a foetus as anything remotely close to a human lifeA twelve week old foetus looks exactly like a little baby, it is far from absurd and actually quite logical to consider it a human life. It quite clearly has a body and so the pro-life position is the foetus has a right to body autonomy.If the pregnancy risks killing the mother, permanently removing her body autonomy, then it is a moral act to perform an abortion.Aborting during a pregnancy with no complications permanently removes the body autonomy of the foetus, so is morally unacceptable. During pregnancy the body autonomy of the mother is suspended to permanently preserve the body autonomy of another human. It is analogous to being handed a newborn baby (a fully dependent organism) when being airlifted from a sinking ship, you temporarily use your body resources to hold the baby until you reach safety, sacrificing your independence and even risking your stability during the rescue.I see OPs pro-choice position as pragmatic and honest, not at all absurd. Abortion will happen whether he feels it morally defensible or not, so to minimise harm it is legalised and performed under clinical conditions. I feel the same way. Recognising that we end human life during abortion but do it anyway really helps me to understand how we behave as a human society.	0.9985172748565674	0.8635388612747192	0.28212007880210876
6	t1_dr3trqa	VladMolina	4.0	"I stipulate that you define \\human being\\"" to mean \\""anything with human DNA\\"" basically, and I will contest your point #2 that it is always immoral to kill human beings. This is defensible under a number of ethical frameworks. If you're a utilitarian, there is no ethical reason not to kill something that can neither suffer nor wish that it will live in the future, and at some early stages of development at the very least, those things are true of unborn human beings. Under a rights-based approach, its not clear that non-persons should have rights, and you concede that there are plenty of reasons to suggest that some unborn human beings are not persons.Let me address your arguments:;We refer to the zygote/fetus as \\""the child\\"", \\""the baby\\"", etc... Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".This just transparently has no moral significance, and in fact many people refer to it as \\""the embryo\\"" or similar, especially in early stages of development where there is no strong argument for full moral personhood.;A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Right, and a cute puppy dying brings extra sadness compared to an ugly puppy dying, but that doesn't imply different moral standing. It just proves we're collectively emotional beings whose feelings are not always evidence of deep moral truths.;Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth.There are many arguments for personhood just a few days before full term that do not hold early in the pregnancy. One doesn't have to defend very late-term or partial-birth abortions in order to defend that some abortions are moral. Also, at this stage, the child can theoretically survive outside the womb without biological obligations to the mother, meaning that abortion is not the only way to protect the woman's right to autonomy over her own body, another potentially important moral difference.;It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.Again, my moral framework would suggest that personhood and moral standing come not in one instant but grow as one develops: the ability to feel pain, the ability to have preferences or hopes for the future, the ability to survive outside the womb, the self-consciousness to wish that one continues to live, all increase one's moral standing. For much of the early stages of development, an embryo or fetus lacks all of these traits."""	0.506832480430603	0.5189319849014282	0.47026729583740234
7	t1_drbbs7j	long-lankin		"You know, it might help if you actually read what Warren has to say. That way you might not blindly make criticisms that she actually answers beforehand. As for being essentially braindead - I am aware that movement in foetuses can be detected as early as eight weeks. However, levels of brain activity are very low, and most brain development occurs after 20 weeks, particularly after the 24 week mark. This encompasses all higher brain function, including the development of the cerebral cortex, adoption of a sleeping/waking cycle, and so on. IIRC, foetuses begin to respond to music at around 20 weeks. I suppose you could consider it able to respond to stimuli, but at 12 weeks it's ultimately little more than a vegetable. As for the violinist analogy, again it would help if you actually read what Thomson has to say, which you quite clearly haven't. Neither Thomson, nor I, have suggested that it presents an absolute right to abortion in all circumstances, and it very true that it is strongest when arguing for the right to abortion in cases of rape. However, it does help to strengthen the case for the right to an abortion nonetheless, particularly when issues of lack of personhood of the foetus are taken into account. That is a large part of the reason why I don't think abortion of a healthy foetus after 24 weeks is acceptable, unless there is a risk to the mother's welfare. A variant of her argument tackles the issue of the right to abortion when having used contraception, and is referred to as the 'people seed' analogy. It manages to make the point that having taken reasonable steps to prevent pregnancy, you have the reasonable expectation of not getting pregnant, and that the ensuing pregnancy would violate your bodily autonomy. I'm sure you'd regard abstinence as the be all and end all, but even that seems to be making assumptions of safety. What if a woman is raped? If she wanted not to get pregnant then should she have had a hysterectomy? Surely she knew there was a chance she'd be raped, and so should have taken absolute measures to ensure she wouldn't get pregnant as result? While provocative, it does raise the point that abstinence is not necessarily the appropriate measure of the reasonable expectation of bodily autonomy, and that the use of contraception could also be considered as such. I don't think it's quite as strong an argument as that of the violinist analogy, but it does help to assert a more general right to bodily autonomy. Once again, when paired with issues of personhood, I think there's a compelling case to be made for the right to an abortion even in cases outside of rape.As with all the works and authors I've referenced so far, I urge you to actually read it for yourself, something you don't seem to have done up to this point. For what it's worth, I'll point you in the direction of what I consider to be the strongest anti-choice arguments - namely, those of Don Marquis in his famous article \\Why Abortion is immoral\\"", and the central point of the right of a foetus to a \\""future like ours\\""."""	0.5890007615089417	0.5264135003089905	0.44116994738578796
