Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	Herdnerfer	-1	Do you think a child is better off having known nothing but the peace of the womb, or being mistreated and abused by parents who didn’t want them for years until they are beaten to death or driven to suicide?	0.99965500831604
2	ZeusThunder369	1	"&gt; Do you think a child is better off having known nothing but the peace of the womb, or being mistreated and abused by parents who didn’t want them for years until they are beaten to death or driven to suicide? The problem with scenarios like this (most common being the \\cases of rape\\"" hypothetical) is that it's kind of a dodge by the person making it usually.IE - If I were to tell you 'okay, abortion will be illegal unless the mother was raped or the parents plan to beat the child to death', sound okay? Of course that wouldn't sound okay; most on either side see abortion as binary and aren't willing to start negotiating terms."""	0.9975384473800659
3	Herdnerfer	2	The problem with those people who want it illegal in all circumstances is that they never talk about what happens to that child AFTER it’s born. Once it’s alive, they just assume their work is done and it will be fine, and in so many cases that is not true. So until we have a solid plan to get that child from womb to 18 years old, saying “abortion is murder” means nothing to me. Murder is murder and it happens to too many sweet little babies every year that just want to play and don’t know why their mom or dad is yelling at them constantly.	0.08932701498270035

5	Herdnerfer	1	Right, and you’re looking at it from a moral perspective, and that’s the perspective I’m trying to give you. Yes it may be killing a life but when that life had high odds of being shitty and miserable, it’s probably better they didn’t have to experience it.	0.0002292364079039544

10	Herdnerfer	1	Not sure that answers my question. There’s a big difference between not being able to afford an Xbox and being beaten and locked in a closet for peeing the bed.	0.9999855160713196
11	Ashiataka	2	You do know that being poor doesn't mean not being able to afford an x Box? I'm talking about not being able to afford food. Surely that's miserable enough to warrant being killed?	0.9990659356117249
