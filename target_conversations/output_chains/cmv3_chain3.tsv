"t3_5shhx3"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"I'm making this CMV because I've noticed that my views on abortion don't really line up with either of the two main viewpoints on it (although they're much closer to a pro-choice viewpoint than a pro-life one). This isn't so much one specific view as it is a collection of related views regarding abortion.I'll specifically list the things that I believe and the things that I don't believe. I think it's good to address both sides because we live in a world where a simple sentence like \\"I support gun rights\\" has people immediately jumping to conclusions about your views on everything from race relations and gay marriage to economic standpoints and foreign policy. Addressing both sides helps to avoid people reaching incorrect conclusions.Important note: For the purposes of this discussion I am writing this with the assumption in mind that a fetus at any point in development is equivalent to a human life. I **do not** believe this and I will explain my reasons for making this assumption in the \\"Things I don't believe\\" section.Also, I am from the U.S.A. and I will be writing this with specific regards to the United States. When I say 'government', 'society', etc. I mean the U.S. government or U.S. society.**Things that I believe***View*: Abortions help society.*Reasoning*: There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies. For starters, every human who is born takes up a lot of resources, and produces a lot of pollution. The average American is responsible for roughly 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita)). Essentially, humans are bad for the environment so less humans is a good thing if we consider climate change to be important.Additionally, unwanted babies are more likely to grow up in bad situations (since they were unwanted), and are more likely to become criminals detrimental to society, or if not criminals then people on welfare which is also detrimental to society. Now yes, it is possible that some aborted baby would have grown up to be the next Einstein. But since it is more likely that they will end up being detrimental to society, I see no reason why we should assume that the less likely of two outcomes will happen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Women of any age, citizenship status, etc. should be able to get an abortion from any abortion clinic for free, no questions asked.*Reasoning*: In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 ([source](https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2014/06/much-abortion-cost-draft-theresas/)). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. If you oppose a doctor simply informing their patient of the facts, then you oppose spreading knowledge and have no place in any sort of philosophical discussion. If you still do not like the fact that the woman may be more likely to choose abortion when they are more aware of the facts, then maybe you should rethink your position on the matter because when people gain knowledge on the subject they become more likely to disagree with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.*Reasoning*: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.Also not that this is fundamentally different from things such as breastfeeding or a mother simply providing food for her child. Breast milk serves no purpose to the mother, and the nutrients stored in food do not belong to anyone until they consume that food. In this way, a fetus in the womb truly does steal nutrients from the mother. A baby does not steal nutrients from the mother, but rather uses nutrients that were either useless to the mother (breastmilk), or provided by the mother as a gift and therefore never the mother's in the first place.----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.*Reasoning*: This point will probably cause the most controversy. Many people will disagree with this because late in the pregnancy, the fetus would be able to survive on its own if it were surgically removed from the woman in the proper manner. However, I believe that just because it would be able to survive on its own does not change the fact that it is still essentially a parasite and the woman still deserves the right to remove that parasite from her body. The fetus, while in the womb, is still feeding off the nutrients of the mother (regardless of whether or not it could survive outside the womb), and therere should be treated as a parasite.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Things that I do not believe***View*: Women should be forced to have abortions.*Reasoning*: This one is obvious but it must be stated, I do not believe that any woman, for any reason, should EVER be forced into having an abortion. Encouraging them is fine, informing them is fine, forcing them is not.--------------------------------------*View*: A fetus's life is equivalent to a human life*Reasoning*: As I mentioned earlier, I want this discussion to be had with the assumption in mind that fetus's are equivalent to human lives. However, I do not believe this is true. The reason I wish for this to be the assumption is that pro-lifers tend to get hung up on this which I know will lead to a meaningless discussion because I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were **uneqivocally proven** that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to \\"I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way.\\"----------------------------------*View*: All killing is bad*Reasoning*: There are many forms of killing that are generally considered acceptable. Soldiers kill other soldiers in wartime, people are allowed to kill in self-defense, and criminals are executed due to their crimes. All of these are perfectly legal forms of killing, and though some are controversial most would agree that at least one of the three is justified. I believe that abortion is another one of these types of killing. This is also why I don't care whether the fetus is a human or not - I view it as a legally and morally justified form of killing.While I am interested in having my view changed, I am also interested in simply having a discussion on the topic.

"t1_ddf3l2x"	"phcullen"	"31"	"Your argument seems to be about u wanted babies, therefore you believe people that are pregnant and don't want a child should have the ability to choose not to. Pro choice. When I think pro abortion policy I imagine more of a default to abortion and having permitted births. At most this view is \i think abortion is a better choice than adoption\\"

"t1_ddf47dk"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"The pro-choice viewpoint centers around the ability for a woman to make a choice (hence the name). They often say things like \\"No one thinks abortion is a good thing, but a woman's right to make choices about her body is more important\\". But I do think that abortion is a good thing (hence me calling it pro-abortion). I think that the fact that it will allow women to make their own choices is a happy side effect, but it is not the core reason that I support easy abortion access.As far as abortion being the default, that's exactly what I do believe should be true. Unfortunately, I don't see any way of doing this without forcing abortions or somehow making humans sterile, which is completely unethical. If there were a good way of doing it I would support that. And when I say default, I mean that social norm should be \\"I am pregnant so I will get an abortion, but I suppose I should consider the alternative of pregnancy\\" rather than \\"I am pregnant, but I suppose I should consider the abortion option\\". That's also why I think doctors should be required to inform patients about it."

But I do think that abortion is a good thing (hence me calling it pro-abortion). Yeah, no, that's still just being pro-choice. *Some* pro-choice people say \\"nobody thinks abortion is a good thing,\\" but others don't. The *only* singular unifying ideology behind the \\"pro-choice\\" label is that abortions should be legal and accessible to women who chose to obtain them. If you believe that, then no matter what else you believe (as long as it isn't contradictory to that) doesn't matter in terms of whether you are \\"pro-choice\\" or not."
"t1_ddf6kta"	"Rockmar1"	"7"	"If that's the case then we need better terminology. I'm sick of only having two choices on anything political, there are more than two positions on every matter.My view is that we should be encouraging abortions as much as possible. This is not what the pro-choice movement is about. Their movement is about giving women rights.Just because I support gun rights doesn't mean I'm republican. Just because I support abortion rights doesn't mean I'm pro choice."
"t1_ddfickx"	"on_my_lunch_break"	"7"	"&gt; My view is that we should be encouraging abortions as much as possible. This is not what the pro-choice movement is about.

"t1_ddfmxw7"	"dragonstorm27"	NA	"I read what OP said as he thinks women should be allowed to choose for themselves, but those that are not in a position financially or emotionally to support a baby should be encouraged as those babies will become a detriment to society, both in their carbon footprint and their statistical chance of becoming a criminal if raised in an unsuitable environment."
"t1_ddfn267"	"on_my_lunch_break"	"7"	"Well, if they'll be allowed to choose for themselves, it sounds like OP is in favor of choice. And in that case, I don't understand how he can reject the label \pro-choice.\\"

"t1_ddfn544"	"dragonstorm27"	NA	"Ehh, OP is in favor of abortion in what some would consider extreme cases, i.e., abortion all the way until birth, abortion should be encouraged to everyone regardless of situation... they're an extreme variant of pro-choice that is tipping quite heavily towards pro-abortion (all abortion) but isn't quite there yet."
"t1_ddfn8zp"	"on_my_lunch_break"	"7"	"Unless you want to mandate abortion and/or encourage women to get pregnant just so they can abort, you're not \\"pro-abortion,\\" you're pro-choice."
