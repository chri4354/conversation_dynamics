The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\a person\\"" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\""Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\""But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

1	t1_dj6onwz	kmar81		"There is no logical conclusion to abortion debate because it is a debate between three points of view - two religious-like dogmatic views and a moderate science-backed view. Since the moderate view is in the middle it is always being polarized and divided by the dogmatic extremes.The dogmatic views are:* the Christian view which fights not only abortion but all forms of birth control because of the dogma of \\human life is sacred\\"" which is defined through religious means and makes no logical sense.* the leftist view that abortion is a right of a woman because whatever is in a woman's body must necessarily fall within the rights of a woman. It is just as dogmatic although there are some logical elements to it, unfortunately the dogma encapsulates the entire argument and it is centered around \\""spiting the conservatives\\"". It is so because it is so and no other considerations are given. In other words it is about the conflict that emerges from abortion which is used to rally people to one camp or another (divide et impera) and not the goal of doing something constructive. It also rejects the notion that reproductive rights of a woman should be matched by reproductive rights of a man (but that will slowly catch up).The moderate view on the other hand can be best explained thus: *human life* is a scientifically meaningless term that requires conscious action to give it meaning in a philosophical sense. That leads to the conclusion that abortion should be legal because there is not sense in criminalizing an act that has no grounds for criminalization (with some exceptions as always) but it should not be promoted or acted upon unless it is absolutely necessary. In other words abortion should be available but the main effort should be focused on preventing it through extensive sex education and contraception."""	0.9795071482658386	0.6339236497879028	0.46787649393081665

I can't imagine what you're trying to say about abortion here that wouldn't also allow you to kill any human you want.	0.00039936613757163286	0.0012062283931300044	0.001413841382600367
