Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\"chooses\\" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."

But as I have no free will then I can't be blamed for having sex without consent as it was predestined, and I too had as much choice as the victim. The physical act is the same in both cases and if we \\"recognise free will as simply an illusion\\" then rape isn't a crime. As such it shouldn't be legal to kill a rapist and therefore abortions should be illegal too.... according to your line of reasoning.At the core, your argument is that 'Mens Rea' the guilty mind shouldn't be recognised in law. To do so would be insane. In fact the idea of insanity itself no longer exists as it is based on the idea of a compromised mind which no longer matters. To say intent and premeditation are irrelevant because free will is an illusion is as valid as saying all guilty acts are irrelevant because nobody had the free will to do them and we shouldn't be held accountable for anything because it was all predetermined."
"t1_dd66wdi"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The difference between sex and rape is that one is desired and consented and the other is not. I don't believe in blaming or lauding people for their actions because they cannot help it. I do believe in having a system of law and justice that can reduce and prevent suffering. Thus crime and justice still exists and is relevant for the sake of protecting people, regardless of the origin of crime being a person who has the freedom to act or a person who is slave to their biology and circumstance.I don't think I am calling into question Mens Rea, but I admit not fully understanding the concept. I'd like to hear more about how this is relevant."
"t1_dd6qiig"	"Negative_Nil"	"1"	"Lets just look at this one central element of what you said.; If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe Free will is an illusion and all acts are determined circumstances of the universe.You aren't justifying abortion with this sentence as you seem to think you are. You are excusing rape. You are saying that it isn't the rapist fault in the same way that it isn't the fetus' fault. As it is already determined to happen because free will is an illusion. But because you know rape is wrong and in your mind you have now equated the two acts you feel justified in saying that this means killing the fetus is okay.Using the idea that free will is an illusion then whenever the question of Mens Rea comes up it can instantly be said that the lack of free will means they had no guilty mind as they weren't capable of controlling their actions.**Whether free will exists or not, you have to accept that it does to have a functioning legal system, or it becomes an excuse for all evil acts.**"
