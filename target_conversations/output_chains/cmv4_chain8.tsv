"jessebanjo"	"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\"chooses\\" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."	NA
"aRabidGerbil"	"3"	"Defending yourself against a rapist is considered acceptable because the rapist is placing you in bodily danger, being pregnant does not place you in any danger (barring complications) so the analogy your presenting is false"
"jessebanjo"	"2"	"a pregnancy is often extremely taxing on the mother's health and emotional state. delivery of a child is extremely painful and frequently dangerous. Rape is also infrequently deadly, but very painful and emotionally taxing so the comparison stands. The bodily harm of an unwanted pregnancy and delivery of a child is comparable to the trauma of being raped."
"aRabidGerbil"	"6"	"Self defense is generally only considered appropriate when the force of a the defense is reasonably proportionate to the force of the attack that is why you will still go to jail if you shoot someone for pushing you, or shouting harassments at you.in the case of abortion you are killing a person in retaliation for slight physical discomfort"
"jessebanjo"	"2"	"This is probably the best response I've heard so far and comes close to CMV. I am hesitant to accept your argument because the degree of physical discomfort, and cost of a pregnancy is really hard to estimate. A pregnancy can be very painful and unpleasant and complications can be life threatening. For this reason, I still believe the suffering of an unwanted pregnancy may be enough to justify the killing."
"aRabidGerbil"	"2"	"Life threatening completions are a very different scenario, even the Catholic Church is okay with an abortion to save a mother's life.You think that the discomfort is worth killing the fetus would you also support a court defendant's statement \\"I had to murder him your honor, if I hadn't I might have experienced 3-9 months of aches and nausea\\"?"
