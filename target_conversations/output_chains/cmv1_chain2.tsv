"ZeusThunder369"	"A zygote/fetus is a human being --&gt; It is immoral to kill human beings --&gt; Thus an abortion is immoral1) There is plenty of reason to suggest that a zygote/fetus is not a person, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't a human being2) Even among pro-choice advocates, most probably would agree that it is immoral to kill human beingsIn order to conclude that an abortion is a morally neutral act, one most disagree with points 1 and/or 2, and I can't see any reasonable way to do that.- We refer to the zygote/fetus as \\"the child\\", \\"the baby\\", etc... Not \\"it\\" or \\"the zygote\\" or \\"the thing\\".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

"ZeusThunder369"	"1"	"&gt; Do you think a child is better off having known nothing but the peace of the womb, or being mistreated and abused by parents who didn’t want them for years until they are beaten to death or driven to suicide? The problem with scenarios like this (most common being the \\"cases of rape\\" hypothetical) is that it's kind of a dodge by the person making it usually.IE - If I were to tell you 'okay, abortion will be illegal unless the mother was raped or the parents plan to beat the child to death', sound okay? Of course that wouldn't sound okay; most on either side see abortion as binary and aren't willing to start negotiating terms."
"Herdnerfer"	"2"	"The problem with those people who want it illegal in all circumstances is that they never talk about what happens to that child AFTER it’s born. Once it’s alive, they just assume their work is done and it will be fine, and in so many cases that is not true. So until we have a solid plan to get that child from womb to 18 years old, saying “abortion is murder” means nothing to me. Murder is murder and it happens to too many sweet little babies every year that just want to play and don’t know why their mom or dad is yelling at them constantly."
"ZeusThunder369"	"0"	"I already agree with the legality of abortion though"
"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"Right, and you’re looking at it from a moral perspective, and that’s the perspective I’m trying to give you. Yes it may be killing a life but when that life had high odds of being shitty and miserable, it’s probably better they didn’t have to experience it."
"Ashiataka"	"2"	"Should we also kill all the poor people?"
"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"What does being poor have to do with being abused and mistreated?"
"Ashiataka"	"2"	"\Yes it may be killing a life but when that life had high odds of being shitty and miserable, it’s probably better they didn’t have to experience it.\\"

"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"Not sure that answers my question. There’s a big difference between not being able to afford an Xbox and being beaten and locked in a closet for peeing the bed."
"Ashiataka"	"2"	"You do know that being poor doesn't mean not being able to afford an x Box? I'm talking about not being able to afford food. Surely that's miserable enough to warrant being killed?"
"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"Maybe you think that, not I."
"Ashiataka"	"2"	"&gt; Yes it may be killing a life but when that life had high odds of being shitty and miserable, it’s probably better they didn’t have to experience it.I'm literally quoting what you said here."
"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"Our opinions of what is shitty and miserable are very different though."
"Ashiataka"	"1"	"How do you know?"
"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"Because you think being poor immediately makes life not worth living and I don’t agree."
"Ashiataka"	"1"	"&gt; when that life had high odds of being shitty and miserable, it’s probably better they didn’t have to experience itOkay, so maybe not the poor people, though there is a correlation, but certainly we should kill people with depression though? How many people do you want to kill because they're not happy?"
"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"I don’t want to kill anyone because they aren’t happy, Not sure where you got that from."
"Ashiataka"	"2"	"&gt; when that life had high odds of being shitty and miserable, it’s probably better they didn’t have to experience itI mean it's literally been in the majority of my responses. You said that if someone's life is 'shitty and miserable', i.e. not happy enough by your standard, then it's not worth living and a good remedy would be not to experience it, i.e. death. I'm just explaining your own comment to you here, I'm not sure where the confusion is? Unless you mean something completely different by what you said, and if so then please explain it because I really hope I've got it wrong."
"Herdnerfer"	"1"	"There’s a difference between aborting a fetus that has a high probability of having to endure pain and suffering at a young age and murdering people who have a shitty life. I’m okay with the former, not the latter."
"Ashiataka"	"1"	"Why?"
