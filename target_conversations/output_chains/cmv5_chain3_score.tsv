0	t3_5ri7y5	awolz	2.0	First, a clarification: I am undecided as to whether abortion is morally right or wrong. I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dd7hc5z	DisappointingTaco	1.0	If you believe that an abortion that saves the mothers life is morally justifiable then why not allow the fact that without the abortion there is a chance of mental deterioration. Would she able to care about the child and how would the child react when they find out they are a product of rape.Adoption is always fine, but where is the morality in forcing a person to give birth to their rapists child. What if a couple was planning a pregnancy and it was unknown if the pregnancy was the result of being planned or the rape? Should the couple be forced to raise a child the are unsure is theirs or have an abortion? Again, what happens when that child grows up and begins to wonder where they are from?Morality always changes even with the same immediate consequences. Think of mercy killing/assisted suicide. We put down our pets to stop them from suffering a prolonged death yet there are those that are horrified at the idea of taking someone off life support.	0.9710351824760437	0.7293038964271545	0.3611598312854767
2	t1_dd7hoov	awolz	2.0	Point taken and accepted, the deterioration of the mother's mental health definitely has to be considered as it can also pose a risk to her life ∆. It may very well be immoral to force a woman to continue with a pregnancy, but aborting a fetus (and thus, to some, murdering entirely innocent human life) could be considered so extortionately worse that the emotional pain suffered by the mother (unless it is so much emotional pain that suicide is likely) that this context is largely irrelevant.	0.826513409614563	0.826513409614563	0.17085298895835876
