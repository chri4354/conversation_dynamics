The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."""		
1	geniebear	38	"Your argument assumes that a fetus and infant are equals, going back to the \\when does life start debate\\"". I'm curious where you stand on that.Also, if a woman, who is biologically programmed to care for potential offspring, decides to terminate a pregnancy, that could be considered an attempt to improve the \\""child's\\"" wellbeing. Not being born could prevent unwanted children who will face neglect, children whose mothers cannot support them (emotionally or financially), or children whose mothers aren't ready for the responsibility. Of course, there are women who will use abortions flippantly, but do you consider these women to be good potential mothers?Also, what of the woman's wellbeing? Having a child she isnt ready for could destroy that. Shouldnt they be allowed to protect themselves from that? Sure, there's risk for having a baby if she has sex, but there's also risk for getting in a car crash if she drives. Neither should be forced upon her."""	0.9995660781860352
