0	t3_69us5b	buzzardsgutsman		"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."""	0.9958481788635254	0.742600679397583	0.3838673532009125

Ancaps, maybe. But they're ancaps.
