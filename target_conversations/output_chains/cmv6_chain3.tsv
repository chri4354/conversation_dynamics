"t1_dghh0ff"	"Huntingmoa"	"55"	"&gt; Is the woman's right to her own body then really the issue at play?It’s one of the issues in play yes. ; The fetus is a human fetus and should therefore have the right of every other human not to be murdered; everyone should have the opportunity to live.Firstly, you are begging the question by using the legal term murder. Plus since abortion is legally not murder, that makes abortion still ok, even if you claim the fetus has a right to not be murdered. ; Many will say that a fetus is not human,I don’t think anyone says this, mostly people say a fetus is not a “person” which is a legal/ethical term (depending on context). ; is dependent on one's genetic makeup rather than what it comes out of.What is the bounding principles for your genetic makeup question? For example, how do you rule in people with genetic abnormalities? How do you rule out tumors (or are those to be legally protected because they are genetically ‘human’)?Additionally, how do you feel about IVF generated embryos? They meet your genetic criteria, should people be legally compelled to bring them to term?; A fetus 5 months into the pregnancy, for example, if born could very well live and grow into an adult. Yet, that very same fetus could also be aborted. Is abortion killing in this scenario? I believe so.In the US, a fetus past viability can have the protection of the state to protect it’s interest. A fetus before viably does not. What legal system are you using to talk about “could be aborted?” or do you mean that the action is possible in the same way I could be shot? Also, you previously called abortion murder, which is different from killing. No one says abortion isn’t cellular death, but so is removing a tumor. You are being fast and loose with terminology. ; I am alright with abortions under extraordinary circumstances, yet do not think that our culture should be promoting it.About 2.6% of pregnancies end in death. What exactly is the cut-off point of extraordinary circumstances, and why should we prevent a woman form making a medical decision about a potentially fatal condition? Why must she risk death to bring a fetus to term?"
"t1_dghib4t"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"\\"Since abortion is legally not murder, that makes abortion still ok\\" I do not think that because something is legal, it is ethical or moral. Slavery was legal, for example. Following your line of reasoning it should have remained legal. You're right about the 'genetic makeup' aspect of my argument; it is indeed very poorly worded (I typed my post quite fast!). What I meant to say is that the fetus has the potential to grow to become a member of society. Potential is the key word, in my opinion. A tumor does not have the potential to become anything other than a tumor. For the same reason that I just mentioned, I am in favor of carrying out IVF embryos to term; the moment that the process has begun, so to speak, it should not be terminated. The reasoning behind this is that the embryo has the potential to become a fully developed member of society. With regards to extraordinary circumstances, I do believe that unless a medical professional asserts that some complications may occur in the pregnancy (whatever they may be), abortion should not be permitted. I think that the woman had a choice with regards to practicing safe or unsafe sexual intercourse. After that choice is made, the woman shares her body with a new human life; nobody forced the woman to become pregnant."
"t1_dghir9v"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; Slavery was legal, for example. Following your line of reasoning it should have remained legal.; You're against slavery? What defines slavery? Because not to downplay the systematic enslavement of black people in America that most Americans are referring to when they say \\"slavery,\\" but I would argue that forcing women to carry pregnancies to term against their will and go through labor and give birth against their will is a form of slavery."
"t1_dghkro9"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"Referring to women who, knowing fully the risks of pregnancy when they engaged in sex, have to carry the unborn child to term as \\"enslaved\\" is an insult to those who have truly suffered this abominable practice. Slaves were, against their will, being coerced into performing labor. Pregnant women had the choice of having sex. You can argue about semantics if you choose to do so, but I will remain firm in my stance that, in no way, will pregnancy ever be considered a form of slavery."
"t1_dghl2l4"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; Referring to women who, knowing fully the risks of pregnancy when they engaged in sexAh ha, no abortion discussion has ever gone on without this being brought up. Elsewhere you gave a delta for pointing out that the conditions under which a fetus are created doesn't affect whether or not it is moral to kill a fetus, so this argument that you bring up is moot. Consenting to sex is not consenting to carrying a pregnancy to term and giving birth. Abortion exists as a medical procedure that has been invented, therefor when a woman engages in sex, she does so knowing that IF she becomes pregnant even though she isn't trying to, she has the option to abort it. Just like when she has sex, she does so knowing that if she gets an STD, there are medical options to take care of it. If someone wants to discourage or restrict a woman from all the options that exist for her in this situation, that person or government body needs a valid reason to do so. \\"You knew this was a possibility when you had sex!\\" isn't a valid reason to restrict women from a medical procedure."
"t1_dghtpfc"	"hartmatthewd"	NA	"You make the argument that because a legal option exists that something is ethical. This is not true; something can be legal yet still immoral. Note that the question is on moral grounds, not legal, so arguments about it's legality are only valid if you're also arguing that things can be moral solely because they are legal.You also make the case that a woman knowingly consenting to something with potentially negative consequences cannot be held morally responsible for that consequence because she's only interested in the act and believes she can get rid of the consequence? That doesn't make sense."

You state that legal abortion exists, which is true, but make no claim that this implies it's ethical. Basically, your decisions once in a situation can be judged on ethical grounds even if you didn't intend to get into that situation."
"t1_dgi2sxe"	"SocialJusticeWizard_"	"1"	"This is becoming circular: abortion shouldn't be allowed because the woman knows pregnancy is a possibility, but women know pregnancies aren't irrevocable. The point is that you can't claim consent for sex is equivalent to consent for pregnancy."
"t1_dgi47nc"	"hartmatthewd"	NA	"You misread a number of things."
