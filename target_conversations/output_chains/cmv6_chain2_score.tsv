1	t1_dgi02wa	waldrop02	2.0	&gt;So if you steal a person's food and medicine and money and remove all stores anywhere in their vicinity, it's not a violation of bodily autonomy?Correct. Stealing their food, medicine, and money would be theft, but not a violation of their bodily autonomy. Removing the stores would be creating a food desert, but also not a violation of their bodily autonomy. ;Or, another example: you could press a button to save someone's life, but technically you wouldn't be killing them if you do nothing? Obviously you would be morally culpable. Not really sure how the two analogies are comparable, but sure, I think it would be morally wrong to do so. I don't think you should be legally forced to press the button though, especially not if it had some massive negative side effects on your life. ;So there is no direct / indirect action distinctionThe right to bodily autonomy is an explanation for why abortion is legal, not why they are morally permissible. Take that up with your faith, I only care about the rights enumerated in the constitution behind respected.	0.07270205765962601	0.3677515387535095	0.44070565700531006

3	t1_dghga3r	[deleted]		It's simple really: Neither abortion nor banning or discouraging abortion is a victimless action. Abortion favors the rights of the woman at the expense of the fetus. Banning or discouraging abortion favors the rights of the fetus at the expense of the woman. ; Rather, we should [...] teach respect for the human life that resides in a woman's body. Doing so would be inherently at the expense of teaching respect for women's bodily autonomy.	0.4494612514972687	0.47247180342674255	0.47326457500457764

5	t1_dghh1lp	Reason_is_Key		Like Telicastraeus said, there is no clear boundary as to what constitutes a woman's right. Is it the woman's right for instance, to kill her two year old son because he is screaming too loud and causing her ear damage? I believe that a woman's right and the right of the fetus are equal.	0.19232960045337677	0.4042610228061676	0.40134668350219727
6	t1_dghy0e4	hunterz5	1.0	The child definitely is using her body in the example though, even indirectly. Unless there's something special about the physical interaction between them that justifies it	0.08257241547107697	0.08257241547107697	0.011599734425544739

8	t1_dghoohd	waldrop02	2.0	&gt;. Is it the woman's right for instance, to kill her two year old son because he is screaming too loud and causing her ear damage?Obviously not. Damaging a person's hearing is a) not illegal and b) not likely to be done by even an hour or two of a toddler screaming. More importantly for the (bad) analogy, the child screaming isn't using the woman's body like a fetus does. *That* is why abortion is legal, because it uses the woman's body. If she doesn't want to have the child anymore, she's more than able to give it up to the state.	0.2381562739610672	0.4591204524040222	0.43157055974006653
9	t1_dghu1an	hunterz5	1.0	So, if a woman has to pay child support, which takes away money she can buy on food, and thus becomes hungry and her body is affected, can she kill the child? It seems so under your system, if it is only the fact that it uses the woman's body that justifies it.	0.9856573343276978	0.9856573343276978	0.007999986410140991
10	t1_dghgrfs	TelicAstraeus	1.0	If a woman wants to have an abortion because she just doesn't want to have a baby... is banning the abortion in that instance violating her rights?
