The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\"Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\"But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

Ask them if they should be forced to give a kidney if they match. It'd be saving a life. They'd probably agree that their bodily integrity outweighs your life. Then ask what the difference is between a kidney and the cells that are sapped from a mother."
"t1_dj6l5jp"	"ShiningConcepts"	"13"	"okay, I'm not even pro-life and even I see issue with the whole organ donor thing. I don't find it very convincing.1) the kidney thing is caused by inaction, not action (like abortions).2) In our society, we view the lives of children more than we do the lives of adults. Two adults are equal and neither's life is more valuable than the other. But it's morally greyer when you compare children with adult.3) The consequences of kidney donation, which last much longer than 9 months (for life), cannot be called (at least unambiguously) lesser/equal to that of pregnancy.4) Most importantly: moral agency. You had nothing to do with what caused those sick people to need a kidney; but you did have something to do with the existence of a child within you.Again, I'm not a pro-lifer and I myself am not convinced by these arguments. I'm just pointing out that they are arguments that sound convincing to a pro-lifer and expose the weakness of this analogy."
"t1_dj6r37x"	"JewshyJ"	"1"	"&gt;If a child is a person, a person is taking cellular material without the express permission of the owner is not legalAgain, you willfully participated in something that caused this to happen therefore it's not illegal (obviously not the case in rape cases, where it's indefensible to be pro-life imo);We do not value the lives of children more than adults. Look at how Trump lives and look at how children live in south side ChicagoJust because not all children live as well as all adults doesn't mean we as a society don't value their lives more than adults. Think about standard lifeboat procedure- \\"women and children first\\". I'm pro-choice in general, and I'm not sure that fetuses can even be classified as people, but there are some clear flaws with these lines of reasoning"
"t1_dj7a355"	"JewshyJ"	"1"	"I'm not really sure what else to say. You accept a risk when you do any activity, including hiking. One risk of sex is pregnancy, so you can't claim your rights are being infringed upon when one of the risks happens."
"t1_dj6q0cg"	"anonoman925"	"17"	"If a child is a person, a person is taking cellular material without the express permission of the owner is not legal.We do not value the lives of children more than adults. Look at how Trump lives and look at how children live in south side Chicago;but you did have something to do with the existence of a child within you.You have to convince me it's a person."
"t1_dj6u1v0"	"anonoman925"	"17"	"Any activity has risk. Why do you equate sex with hiking. Why isn't sex like going outside?"
"t1_dj6rwi2"	"anonoman925"	"17"	"So if a woman doesn't willfully want to get pregnant, then what?We say we value their lives more, but actions say we don't. How we feel about ourselves should not set public policy."
"t1_dj6szsg"	"JewshyJ"	"1"	"You took a risk in having sex; getting pregnant is always a possibility. Because of this, it's not illegal for a person to be taking the cellular material of a child without permission. After all, you forced the fetus into the situation it's in.It's like hiking in a dangerous area; it's a risk, so you have to accept the consequences of that risk.As for the other point, you may be right. I can't currently think of any examples of laws enacted specifically to protect children that could be pinned strictly on them being children."
"t1_dj7guzc"	"anonoman925"	"17"	"You seem to be prioritizing one risk over the other. Should I be held MORE responsible for my actions if I have sex and get pregnant or go outside and get mugged if my goal was to neither get pregnant or get mugged. If I live in a shitty neighborhood, is it my fault if I'm robber? I know the consequences. You can say it's a question of exercising free will. Sex is consensual, living in a shitty neighborhood is not. But what does free will matter in the face of consequence. I did not exercise free will when I rear ended a car. I'd be a psychopath. If I had free will I'd choose not to. And I'd have to accept the consequences. It's not a matter of free will. Both getting pregnant and getting mugged is a function of cause and effect. If you intended to get pregnant, there's a moral question if you change your mind. If you did not intend to get pregnant, there are consequences, but there is not some lingering moral question. Just because people place a higher moral value on pregnancy doesn't mean anything. As a society we've changed our minds so much on the value of life. If you ~~feel~~ as though there is a higher moral value on a fetus, then you're implicitly pro-life."
