"Daniel_A_Johnson"	"807"	"I'm pro-choice, but I also think that the traditional talking points on both sides completely ignore those on the other side. The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.That being said, we as a society don't care about human life above all else, nor should we. Life has a variable value depending on the factors weighed against it.You're not allowed to kill a person outside of a uterus, true. But we as a society don't really go out of our way to save lives even when it would be easy to do so. When the federal maximum speed limit was up for review, experts in the field showed irrefutable evidence that keeping the speed limit at 65 mph saved X number of lives per year, and we, as a nation responded, in a unified voice, \\"Ehhh, but we like to go fast.\\"But sure, that's personal choice. On the other hand, nothing actually says you can't have your kids in the car when you drive 85 miles per hour across the open plains of Texas. Sure they have to be wearing their seat belts, but if we really wanted them safe, shouldn't the kids be wearing helmets, too?You could make the argument that it's a question of commission vs. omission, but since we're talking about children, we've already crossed that philosophical bridge. Once they're born, you can't just leave them to fend for themselves, or you go to jail._____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators. We'd like to remind you of a couple of things.

"ralph-j"	"215"	"&gt; The simple fact is that trying to define the point at which a zygote or a fetus becomes \\"a person\\" is pointless. Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.How is conception not just another one out of many arbitrary points various parties have proposed?I'd agree that at conception, the clump of cells can be shown to be *alive* and *of human origin*, but that does not make them \\"a human life\\", \\"a person\\", or anything like that. The latter two are loaded terms and depend on how we define what a human life is in the first place, and that is necessarily arbitrary.I agree with the rest of your post, and I believe that bodily integrity should be decisive, not personhood or humanness or any such wishy-washy term."
"Daniel_A_Johnson"	"35"	"&gt; bodily integrity should be decisiveIsn't it troubling to make an ethical distinction that hinges on technological advancement? What makes a 24-week fetus conceived in 2017 more deserving of human rights than one conceived in 1950?For that matter, if the technology were ever developed to support a fetus from 2 weeks after conception, should the law change?"
"MerrieLee"	"68"	"&gt; Isn't it troubling to make an ethical distinction that hinges on technological advancement? So let it hinge on birth rather than on anything prior to birth. Because even letting it hinge on conception is based on technological advancement, because how do we even know when conception happens? We don't. Medical technology can try to deduce it but we still don't know for sure. If we don't want this ethical discussion to hinge on technology, then when the fetus exists the woman's body via birth would be the factor to hinge it on instead of any factors prior to that moment. Plus there's the added bonus that birth is the most clear-cut and least arbitrary factor of all. Prior to birth, the being is a fetus that exists only inside a woman; after birth the being is a baby that exists on its own."
"Daniel_A_Johnson"	"31"	"Sure. I was using conception because it's the one brought up most often. You could definitely make an equally valid claim for birth as the dividing line. ∆!But I think you'd have even less fun convincing people that it's not killing if you abort a fetus right up until the moment you cut the umbilical cord than I have convincing people that the solution is to just make peace with the idea of killing people."
"MerrieLee"	"96"	"&gt;But I think you'd have even less fun convincing people that it's not killing if you abort a fetus right up until the moment you cut the umbilical cord than I have convincing people that the solution is to just make peace with the idea of killing people.What you say to people in that case is that women don't decide to carry a pregnancy to term for 8-9 months *then* get an abortion just for fun. Less than 1% of all abortions are performed in the third trimester and they're performed because a test revealed huge medical or physical deformities in the fetus or life-threatening complications in the pregnancy. The only late term abortions that are performed are medically necessary, therefor laws limiting late term abortions aren't even needed because women don't want them anyway and the women who do get them *need* them and the laws preventing them only serve to complicate the medical care that women in those situations need to receive. Just like we don't need a law saying it's illegal to cut off your own arm, we also don't need a law saying it's illegal to carry a pregnancy to term for 9 months *then* abort it. Nobody in their right mind would do either thing anyway. We can trust women and doctors to make the medically correct decisions for their bodies and we don't need a law about it one way or another."
"CompGrl323"	"28"	"Δ I've always been pro-choice, but unsure about how far into pregnancy abortion should be legal. You've made a good point here about how nobody actually gets abortions in the third trimester unless they medically need to - anyone who doesn't want a child would have decided way before then."
"this_is_theone"	"0"	"&gt; anyone who doesn't want a child would have decided way before then.Couldn't this also be an argument for why it should remain illegal?"
"wonko221"	"2"	"Illegal is not a natural state. It means a law has been written to prohibit the third trimester abortion.Going with the theory, framed in the US Constitution, that no law should be written unless it is both necessary and proper, any law written that isn't both necessary and proper should be stricken. If people aren't having third trimester abortions except under extreme circumstances that call for allowing an abortion, the law isn't necessary; it doesn't correct any actual harmful behaviour.The law was implemented as part of a strategy to \\"move the goal posts\\" on abortion prohibition. Once they get the law written, they can find new ways to argue that the limit should be pushed further, based on new criteria, until abortion is outlawed outright.This means that the law was not written because it was necessary, and further that it is deceitful in essence, and therefore it is improper.The legal prohibition of third trimester abortions is unnecessary and improper."
"this_is_theone"	"1"	"&gt; If people aren't having third trimester abortions except under extreme circumstances that call for allowing an abortion, the law isn't necessary; it doesn't correct any actual harmful behaviour.They aren't now, because it's illegal. Make it legal and I'd wager it happening a lot more. I'm pro choice but I think it's more complicated than that."
"wonko221"	"2"	"Instead of wagering, look at the facts before third trimester abortions were outlawed in us states. States ramped up their push for laws against third trimester abortions in the recent past, as a partisan wedge issue.It was not in response to an epidemic of late term abortions.The laws didn't practically change behavior; they are partisan hackery, and are an effort to set precedents that can be used to support further prohibitions.Edit: alternatively, look at states that don't ban third trimester abortions, and find the epidemic: Alaska, Colorado, D C., Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, and West Virginia."
"this_is_theone"	"1"	"Well I never thought it was an epidemic. I've tried googling to find out more about the law but I can't find an answer to this so I'm hoping you can help. In places where there is a law against third trimester pregnancy's, do they still allow for an abortion if there is a risk to the mothers life? Or does it vary place to place?"
"wonko221"	"2"	"My answers are based on the US. There is no federal law restricting abortion access, but Roe v. Wade generally gives the states some latitude in prohibiting abortions along certain criteria, ventral tied to \\"post viability\\" if the fetus. The US Supreme Court has upheld that states must provide exceptions to protect the mothers life; some states define threats to the mother's life in dishonest ways. In Texas, for instance, the state legislation shut down any abortion clinics that didn't have certain sized operating rooms, or if the doctor's didn't have admitting privelleges at a nearby hospital with an emergency room. They claimed it was to protect mothers in the event something went wrong during the procedure, thereby setting restrictions based on threats to the mother's life.In practicality, there was limited risk to mothers, but the arbitrary requirements were so narrowly tailored that only four abortion clinics statewide would be allowed to operate. It was framed as a protection to mothers, but was actually designed to present an inappropriate hurdle to women seeking abortions, crafted sneakily within loopholes in supreme court precedent."
"this_is_theone"	"1"	"Thanks for getting back to me. I think maybe I didn't word my question well. What I meant is, in such states that outlaw third trimester abortion, do they make an exception in cases where the mother could be at risk if she was to have the child?"
