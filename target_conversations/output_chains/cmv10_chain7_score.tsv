0	t3_69us5b	buzzardsgutsman		"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."""	0.9958481788635254	0.742600679397583	0.3838673532009125
1	t1_dhajwf3	LickABoss1		The fundamental difference is that, while children can be transferred to different parents if the current parents don't want to or cannot care for them, a fetus in a womb cannot be transferred to a different womb if a mother doesn't want to or cannot birth the child. In addition, child neglect doesn't fall under body autonomy because the child consciously suffers from any neglect, while an aborted fetus feels nothing as it lacks consciousness, and doesn't even have the capability to feel anything until something like 23 weeks.	0.8955289125442505	0.8955289125442505	0.1042584478855133
2	t1_dhakgey	buzzardsgutsman		Bodily autonomy is not conditional on options, at least not when you take an absolute stance on it like pro-choicers do. You can choose to either provide for another individual or not.Bodily autonomy is also not conditional on suffering. Otherwise, we could force people to donate kidneys to people who were suffering from renal failure. A right to do what you want with your body is not affected by the circumstances of other individuals around you.	0.4647683799266815	0.42893069982528687	0.3823496401309967
3	t1_dhalfd9	LickABoss1		I don't disagree with either statement. What I meant was that it's wrong to neglect a child not because people shouldn't have a choice about whether to care for a child, but because there are other services that can be used to avoid suffering of the child if the parents choose not to care for a child. Abortion is a different matter because no alternative service exists to take care of an unwanted pregnancy, so to not allow abortion would be to cut off body autonomy. An example to prove my point: Jill doesn't want to care for her infant son Jeremy. Foster care and adoption exist, so that enables Jill to keep bodily autonomy without inflicting unnecessary suffering on Jeremy. Example two: Jill is pregnant with Jeremy and doesn't want to give birth to him. There is no alternative way to maintain Jill's bodily autonomy, so abortion is the only option.	0.9121894240379333	0.7136490941047668	0.3380635976791382
