It's likely that every single time a fertile couple has sex, there's a conception. Two-thirds of these conceptions fail before even being able to register on a pregnancy test.Another fifth fail shortly afterwards.Most of these probably weren't viable with life, but some were, and just failed for whatever reason biology threw at them. It doesn't make sense to sentimentalise every conception as a \\"tiny human being\\". The reality is that most conceptions are a new (and frequently unviable) arrangement of DNA in an embryonic form, to be discarded by some natural process."
"t1_dgils89"	"hbsquatch"	NA	"key word being natural process.I think people get overly hung up on the concept of where does life begin and defining that. If you believe in a deity that says murder is bad, it is really that deity that knows the answer to the question. SO in absence of that divine knowledge we are left with science.So here is my opinion. IF i went into an ER with an injury and hooked up to machines, I would be pronounced dead when my heart stopped. Death is the opposite of life so one would assume you are pronounced alive when your heart starts.THere is also the personhood issue. When is a person an person. The first test is really easy. Until a human gives birth to a kitten. puppy or other animal, then my money is on the fact that every human pregnancy will result in a human. The second factor is DNA. Outside of identical twins, DNA is the most foolproof identifier of personhood and of the individual. If two different DNA samples are at a crime scene, we know two people were at the crime scene. If a fetus has a separate DNA from the mother then it is a separate person. SO until that day when a mother gives birth to an identical twin, my logic tells me that a separate being with distinct DNA is another person inside you."
