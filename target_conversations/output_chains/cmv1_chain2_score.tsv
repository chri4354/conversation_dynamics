Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

The problem with scenarios like this (most common being the \\cases of rape\\"" hypothetical) is that it's kind of a dodge by the person making it usually.IE - If I were to tell you 'okay, abortion will be illegal unless the mother was raped or the parents plan to beat the child to death', sound okay? Of course that wouldn't sound okay; most on either side see abortion as binary and aren't willing to start negotiating terms."""	0.9380550384521484	0.6486827731132507	0.4518068730831146
3	t1_dr3r3u7	Herdnerfer	5.0	The problem with those people who want it illegal in all circumstances is that they never talk about what happens to that child AFTER it’s born. Once it’s alive, they just assume their work is done and it will be fine, and in so many cases that is not true. So until we have a solid plan to get that child from womb to 18 years old, saying “abortion is murder” means nothing to me. Murder is murder and it happens to too many sweet little babies every year that just want to play and don’t know why their mom or dad is yelling at them constantly.	0.505719780921936	0.5026942491531372	0.49624475836753845
