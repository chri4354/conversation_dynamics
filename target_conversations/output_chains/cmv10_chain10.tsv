The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\"lending\\" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."
"t1_dhci82h"	"regice_fhtagn"	"1"	"Two basic points in my view: -After a child is born, we have ways of both caring for it and preserving the mother's free choice, without having to sacrifice either. (In theory, we have facilities for raising unwanted children. In practice they're not that great, but it's something we can strive for.) Before a child is born, there just isn't any way of preserving both life and liberty (as far as I know). Is it hypocritical to defend a child's life and not the life of a fetus, based solely on what we can and can't do? Maybe, but reality is a bitch sometimes. -Personal opinion (so feel free to criticize anything you see wrong with this): the liberty of \\"what am I doing with my time\\", though a strong one, is still not in the same order of magnitude as the liberty of \\"what am I doing with my body\\". These are both important, but the latter just somehow feels like it's even more fundamental. Even if we did, as a society, mandate that new parents spend time and effort taking care of their children (which I don't think we do, exactly), it wouldn't necessarily be hypocritical not to say the same for unborn children."
