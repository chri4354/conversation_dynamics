Not \\""it\\"" or \\""the zygote\\"" or \\""the thing\\"".- A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\""the baby\\"" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).- Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.- It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.*Explanation of title: I don't believe that all immoral acts should automatically be illegal; It's a case by case basis. In the case of abortion, I don't think the state should be forcibly preventing people from getting abortions or imprisoning them against their will because they got an abortion.*_____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

1	t1_dr3rwhx	ThomasEdmund84	9.0	Most acts aren't straight immoral or moral, they are a chaos of different factors that are often impossible to completely resolve.I actually tend to agree with you, I'm pro-choice because I believe the ethical decision making is in the mother's hands not the stands, I'm not pro-choice because I believe that abortion is ethically benign.BUT I don't think its easy to conclude that abortion is an immoral act. Yes most people think its wrong to end another humans life, however in almost all other cases other humans do not have such an impact on the decision makers life. When taking about abortion people tend to minimize parental impact, parenting is like the hardest thing that people ever do for people who *intentionally* have children. Also it's important to acknowledge that abortion isn't technically ending a life as removing a pregnancy that happens to require that an unborn child dies.Think of it like this. A random alien attaches itself to your body and starts to suck nutrients from you. The alien informs you that should you sever that tie it will in fact die. It also informs you that in 9 months it will painfully and riskily detach from you, however you still have to provide for is for 18+ years. Now its morally wrong to simply kill other creatures, however is it morally wrong to severe that tube of your own volition? You're not necessarily acting to *kill* them you're acting to maintain your own autonomy.Pro-lifers at this point start extolling the virtues of abstinence, regardless of your views on this I thinks its at the very least fair to say that its too complex to simply conclude abortion is immoral. Sorry I've waffled for ages, I probably could have summed this up:tl;dr no abortion isn't ethically benign but its complicated enough to warrant not coming to a solid 'this is wrong' conclusion.	0.7958002090454102	0.5591450929641724	0.4552152454853058
2	t1_dr4fczk	Jukebawks		Well here's the thing though, the alien in your example randomly comes up and attaches to you. However, a baby is created, usually because you willingly had sex, but didn't take the necessary steps to prevent the pregnancy. There are many options: diaphragms, male condom, birth control, foams, morning after pill, etc. All the issues come AFTER the fact that you made the decision to have sex in the first place. No one forced you to have sex, in this example at least. I'm only talking about voluntary sex. You decided, and there are consequences to that. The alien is a separate entity that you had no control over whatsoever. A pregnancy however is something that came about as a direct result of your actions.	0.9938868880271912	0.7128387093544006	0.40847572684288025
3	t1_dr4jca4	DOCisaPOG		If you argue that abortions are justified in cases of rape but not in other situations, then you agree that in some cases the needs of the women outweigh the needs of the fetus. Now we need to establish at what point we draw that line.	0.4534659683704376	0.4534659683704376	0.45268145203590393
4	t1_dr4jr50	Jukebawks		"How about if you have sex and get pregnant, you should abort it on your own dime. That way you realize the responsibility you have, and you'll be more responsible because abortion is expensive. Otherwise, have safe sex or less sex. Get on birth control, get a diaphragm, male condoms, and a host of other contraceptives give you up to a 99% chance of blocking pregnancy. If you are not taking some of these steps, you're being irresponsible. You should pay for your own mistakes. If you don't, you destroy the incentive to be responsible, and a lot more people become less responsible because they don't have to pay for it. If a business fails, they failed because they were doing something wrong. They were either providing a service or good people didn't need, it was too expensive, it was defective or whatever the reason is. They should be allowed to fail. No one should be responsible for paying for their failures except themselves. You take the risk. If you take the risk away, then they will act more recklessly. The government guaranteed sub-prime loans to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae refused to take certain loans because there was too much risk attached to it. The government told them they had to and not to worry because the government would guarantee the sub prime loans. So what did Fannie Mae do? They capitalized on a risk free loan, because the gov't guaranteed it, and bought as many subprime loans as possible. If the government hadn't guaranteed them then they wouldn't have taken out the loans. If tomorrow, the government said, \\If your business fails, we will subsidize it.\\"", every single person out there would take as many loans as humanly possible and start businesses and when 99% of them fail because they weren't thought out at all, they will go to the government for their handouts. But people don't do that right now because they would take the risk and fail. That risk of failure is the only thing keeping people from spending their money recklessly. It's a natural part of the free market that forces you to think responsibly. A policy of personal responsibility fosters more responsible people. A policy of no fault because of society will foster less responsible people. I'd rather not live in a society that decides that just because I make 500 dollars more than them a year, they can now come take that away from me. I've had a pretty shitty life. Does that give me the right to rob and steal from you? I don't think so."""	0.958149790763855	0.6376429796218872	0.44350022077560425
5	t1_dr4u5rf	DOCisaPOG		It seems you're much more concerned with the fiscal side of the matter than the moral side. Nailing down the net cost to society of an abortion vs carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term and surrendering the child in an orphanage is an argument that could go on for days.	0.9993252158164978	0.9993252158164978	0.00038230419158935547
6	t1_dr4vbuv	Jukebawks		If you're worried about morality, no one is stopping you from donating everything after $30k to someone making less than you. No one is stopping you from volunteering your time at a soup kitchen. The fact of the matter is, if you want, there are dozens of avenues and ways to help someone in need. You can start a gofundme for the homeless or start a charitable group. You can donate as much as you want or as little as you want. However the government, being as ineffective and irresponsible as it is, can't seem to solve the problems with trillions of dollars. The government itself doesn't earn money. The only way to get money is to tax the people in the country. You have to remember that while a business aims for profit, it's dependent on your whims. A business has to sell you a good or service in return for your money. It's a voluntary exchange. If you don't need or want it, you don't have to buy it. It can't force you to buy a product. So for instance, if you had issues with Nike's child slavery in the 90's, you had the choice and the vote with your dollar to not buy their products. Government agencies and departments are supposed to fix a problem in society. When governments can regulate certain businesses and industries, that gives them the power to benefit certain businesses. That's how lobbying occurs. If the government itself couldn't affect business with regulation, there would be no reason for lobbyists because the government wouldn't have power to benefit them in certain ways, ie regulate another competitor out of business, make things advantageous for them, etc. Another point is that bureaucrats and gov't agency workers are not elected like politicians. They do not directly answer to the people. On top of that, while a department is created to solve a problem, in order for those people to retain those jobs, they have to not solve the problem. As in, they will have job longevity if the problem is not solved. Their primary motive is not to solve the problem, but to keep their job as long as possible. At least in the free market, your whims are judged by the consumer's dollars. At least there's a way for bad businesses to fail. In the government, bad agencies are given more and more money. If you're business is failing, no matter how much money you throw at it, it will keep failing. That's what government does. It just adds more and more money to a problem hoping to fix it, but they don't even understand all the variables that go into solving the problem. And some problems can't be solved with just money thrown into the system.	0.6128734946250916	0.5180684924125671	0.45386847853660583
7	t1_dr4vq4s	DOCisaPOG		Again, this conversation isn't at all about government regulations or funding. We are trying to come to a consensus about if the termination of a fetus is moral or immoral.	0.9994331002235413	0.9994331002235413	0.00015485286712646484
8	t1_dr4w49u	Jukebawks		The government shouldn't be in it whatsoever. In my opinion, the best situation would be to terminate as soon as you find out and you don't want it. As soon as possible before the heart starts beating and the organs start forming. That's just my opinion. I don't believe in forcing my opinion on people. All I can do is try to convince you with my opinion if you so choose to hear it.	0.846004843711853	0.7334883213043213	0.33556264638900757
9	t1_dr5coal	DOCisaPOG		"Ok, that makes sense now. You and I are in agreement. To bring it back to OP's question, does that mean the act of abortion is immoral in all cases and we have just agreed as a society that some immoral things are acceptable, or can abortion be considered moral in some cases?Also, as a side question, do you mentioned \\the best situation would be to terminate as soon as you find out and you don't want it. As soon as possible before the heart starts beating and the organs start forming.\\"" Is that a hard line you draw in terms of when abortion is taken off the table, or is it just more preferable to a more developed fetus? Does the level of development of the fetus play into how immoral or moral a termination would be?"""	0.9819404482841492	0.8323851823806763	0.33269408345222473
10	t1_dr5hlyw	Jukebawks		It is immoral in all cases, but humans put their own comfort ahead of others, so it's not unnatural. I think it would moral in cases of incest/rape. With underage teens it gets a bit murky. We don't think children understand the full consequences of their actions so they're given leeway. Even though I think it's immoral in all cases, I think earlier is better if possible. In a perfect world I would prefer the morning after pill for abortions constantly or no abortions at all. But then my fiscally conservative side asks who will pay for the welfare and care of the children born and put into the foster care system? I heard 50% of the children either die in the streets or go to prison within 2 years of aging out of the system. That's a pretty damn horrible future to leave a child to. Which is better? I don't know.	0.001984846778213978	0.27292439341545105	0.4021089971065521
