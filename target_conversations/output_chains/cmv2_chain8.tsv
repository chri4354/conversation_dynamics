I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible."
