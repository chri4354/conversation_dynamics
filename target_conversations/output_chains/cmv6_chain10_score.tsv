1	[deleted]	4	It's simple really: Neither abortion nor banning or discouraging abortion is a victimless action. Abortion favors the rights of the woman at the expense of the fetus. Banning or discouraging abortion favors the rights of the fetus at the expense of the woman. ; Rather, we should [...] teach respect for the human life that resides in a woman's body. Doing so would be inherently at the expense of teaching respect for women's bodily autonomy.	0.45863771438598633
2	TelicAstraeus	2	If a woman wants to have an abortion because she just doesn't want to have a baby... is banning the abortion in that instance violating her rights? If a woman wants to kill her 10 year old son because she just doesn't feel like having a son anymore, is banning the murder of that son in that instance violating her rights?	0.3297228515148163
3	Reason_is_Key	2	Like Telicastraeus said, there is no clear boundary as to what constitutes a woman's right. Is it the woman's right for instance, to kill her two year old son because he is screaming too loud and causing her ear damage? I believe that a woman's right and the right of the fetus are equal.	0.9980972409248352
4	waldrop02	2	&gt;. Is it the woman's right for instance, to kill her two year old son because he is screaming too loud and causing her ear damage?Obviously not. Damaging a person's hearing is a) not illegal and b) not likely to be done by even an hour or two of a toddler screaming. More importantly for the (bad) analogy, the child screaming isn't using the woman's body like a fetus does. *That* is why abortion is legal, because it uses the woman's body. If she doesn't want to have the child anymore, she's more than able to give it up to the state.	0.9962310194969177
5	hunterz5	-1	So, if a woman has to pay child support, which takes away money she can buy on food, and thus becomes hungry and her body is affected, can she kill the child? It seems so under your system, if it is only the fact that it uses the woman's body that justifies it.	0.5766618251800537
6	waldrop02	3	"I will never ceased to be amazed by the ways my fellow men will intentionally misunderstand what \\bodily autonomy\\"" is. To answer your question though, no. The child is not using her body, so no."""	0.8123341202735901
7	hunterz5	0	The child definitely is using her body in the example though, even indirectly. Unless there's something special about the physical interaction between them that justifies it	0.2034606784582138
8	PxM23	1	Indirectly vs directly is the key term here then.	0.9967470169067383
9	hunterz5	1	Why is the distinction important?	0.06434784084558487
