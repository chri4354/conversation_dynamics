"awolz"	"First, a clarification: I am undecided as to whether abortion is morally right or wrong. I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

"Amablue"	"36"	"Consider the following two scenarios:1. A driver maliciously runs over someone they hate, an ex perhaps, killing them. 2. A driver loses control of their car striking a pedestrian, killing them. Both of these situations in the abstract are very similar. A person behind the wheel of a car kills a person. However, that does not mean we treat these cases the same when they go to court. While the first driver will almost certainly go to jail, the second one may not. Despite being in essentially the same action, we deprive one person of their freedom and the other one we do not. The reason is obvious: The first driver made a conscious choice to do something, and is therefore must be held responsible for their choice. The second person did not decide to kill a person. Perhaps they were trying to swerve to miss something else, or the pedestrian was wearing black and jaywalking in the middle of the night, or the driver suffered a sudden seizure - there are all kinds of situations where the driver may have done little or nothing wrong. If this is the case, they are a victim of circumstance, and so we don't hold them accountable for the situation they were a part of. Many people believe that fetuses are alive, and that by having sex you are waiving your right to not be pregnant. To them, when you choose to take a risky action it's not permissible to commit murder to get out of dealing with the consequences of that action. However, if you are raped, that's not a situation you chose to be in. You never waived your right to your body. You didn't choose this situation, so your freedom isn't deprived. Yes, a life is still ended, but it wasn't your responsibility to give birth to that child in the first place. Note that I don't agree with that view, but if you accept the premises I gave then the logic makes sense."
"awolz"	"12"	"A lot of the points on this thread have been very convincing, but this most-so; the attention bought to the different ways we treat responsibility is more relevant than originally thought. âˆ†"
"PaladinXT"	"3"	"Can you please elaborate on how responsibility changed your view?So far it seems like the analogy is a false equivalence in that whether or not someone goes to jail is unlike whether or not a life should pay the consequences of someone else's actions.I may be misunderstanding something and am open to correction."
"theghostmachine"	"3"	"The going to jail part isn't important. There's three things we're looking at it in both examples: action, intent behind the action, and consequences. The action and the consequences aren't the part we are most interested in; it's the intent. Did the guy intend to run that pedestrian over? Did that woman intend to risk getting pregnant? That's where the morality of the situation can change, and the consequences are dictated by it. It's not immoral that someone accidentally hit and killed a person, for whatever reason. It's not immoral that a woman end her pregnancy because she was raped. In neither case did the person choose to be in that situation. The comparison is fair, I think you were just focusing on the wrong parts."
"z3r0shade"	"1"	"&gt; Did the guy intend to run that pedestrian over? Did that woman intend to risk getting pregnant? That's where the morality of the situation can change, and the consequences are dictated by it.I disagree completely. It's a false equivalence. If the thing that makes abortion immoral is the \\"killing of an innocent person\\" then how she got pregnant is irrelevant to the morality of abortion because regardless the fetus had no say. The problem is that if we look at the intent of the woman who got pregnant, then we're declaring that what makes abortion immoral is the woman choosing to have sex and not wanting to carry it to term rather than killing the fetus.A more accurate analogy would be to take a pedestrian being hit by a driver and say that if the driver didn't intend to hit them and wasn't doing anything risky they aren't financially or morally responsible for the medical care of the victim and the victim is on their own. But if they took any action that carried a risk of hitting the pedestrian then suddenly they should be held responsible.I believe we can all agree that it doesn't matter if you intended to hit the pedestrian, if you hit someone then you are responsible."
"mcstouty"	"2"	"I don't think your analogy is any more accurate. The analogy as written assumes that the driver had no agency whatsoever in being behind the wheel in the first place. By driving the car they are implicitly taking responsibility because they are operating an object that presents a danger to pedestrians regardless of their intended actions. In the case of rape, by definition the woman has no agency: she is the pedestrian in the analogy, not the driver.So then, we have two pedestrians: the woman and the fetus. Now we have to decide whose rights take precedence, but that's outside the scope of the original CMV.Edited to add: I think all of this could be avoided by not shaming people for having sex in the first place. Contraception is accessible to just about everyone (with some sad exceptions) and mistakes happen. Having an abortion can an unpleasant experience to say the least, and if what I've learned from women in my life is true, no woman thinks of abortion as a kind of routine contraception to rely on. Even if it's a moral issue for the woman herself, the world should let it be hers to struggle with and stop trying to force her to feel worse than she already does. In my view, at least until the fetus could reasonably survive outside the womb, it's literally another part of the woman's body, and therefore her own to give up."
"theghostmachine"	"2"	"Your edit, I absolutely agree with and think that that mindset solves the whole problem.I also have come around to agreeing the original analogy isn't perfect, but I still believe it's a fair, if not totally accurate, analogy to use to at least help get the idea across."
