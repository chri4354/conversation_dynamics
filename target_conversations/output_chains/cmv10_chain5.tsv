"t3_69us5b"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\"lending\\" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice... No?I am interested in hearing any rebuttals of this."

This argument is based on the idea that foetus is not a human being. Thus, the argument cannot be extended to children."
"t1_dhagifz"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"I think this is fundamentally incorrect. The most famous defense of abortion in philosophy was Judith Jarvis Thompson's 1971 essay on bodily autonomy, which has been since expanded on by others. It made the concession that the foetus is a fully fledged human being from the moment of conception."
"t1_dhajfnl"	"Therenar"	NA	"I fail to see how that is relevant to your question. Your issue was that the \\"work off apresumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children\\". But it is not. It is based on the presumption that foetus is not a human being. I don't think that any advocate of abortion would claim that a foetus is a human being (or only a minority would say that).Whether foetus is a human being or not is another issue."
"t1_dhajpq3"	"buzzardsgutsman"	NA	"I am only citing the most common philosophical defense of abortion, which has formed the basis for Roe V Wade and most subsequent discussion on this subject. It basically works with the idea that a foetus may be a human being, but it is still morally acceptable to abort it because of *bodily autonomy rights*.I am then saying that, if we accept this argument, we have to concede that parents have no moral obligations to ensure the welfare of their children, anymore than they do a total stranger. Because that's what the bodily autonomy case is saying - you don't owe the child any duty or obligation of care, so you can choose to remove it from your body even if it dies. I don't see how this doesn't extent to children as well."
"t1_dhal1z2"	"Therenar"	NA	"Just because a particular argument is the most common in the field of philosophy does not mean that advocates of abortion follow that argument. You state that:; The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\"lending\\" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb.You extend this argument so that it applies to children. However, people who are in agreement with the aforementioned view often don't believe that foetus is a human being, therefore this argument cannot be extended to human beings, including children.So, your question is not how \\"it is my body argument works\\", but rather how \\"it is my body argument works *if we assume that foetus is a human being*\\".However, as I stated above, majority of people who are okay with abortion think that foetus is not a human being."
