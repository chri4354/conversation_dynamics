"Rockmar1","I'm making this CMV because I've noticed that my views on abortion don't really line up with either of the two main viewpoints on it (although they're much closer to a pro-choice viewpoint than a pro-life one). This isn't so much one specific view as it is a collection of related views regarding abortion.I'll specifically list the things that I believe and the things that I don't believe. I think it's good to address both sides because we live in a world where a simple sentence like \\"I support gun rights\\" has people immediately jumping to conclusions about your views on everything from race relations and gay marriage to economic standpoints and foreign policy. Addressing both sides helps to avoid people reaching incorrect conclusions.Important note: For the purposes of this discussion I am writing this with the assumption in mind that a fetus at any point in development is equivalent to a human life. I **do not** believe this and I will explain my reasons for making this assumption in the \\"Things I don't believe\\" section.Also, I am from the U.S.A. and I will be writing this with specific regards to the United States. When I say 'government', 'society', etc. I mean the U.S. government or U.S. society.**Things that I believe***View*: Abortions help society.*Reasoning*: There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies. For starters, every human who is born takes up a lot of resources, and produces a lot of pollution. The average American is responsible for roughly 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita)). Essentially, humans are bad for the environment so less humans is a good thing if we consider climate change to be important.Additionally, unwanted babies are more likely to grow up in bad situations (since they were unwanted), and are more likely to become criminals detrimental to society, or if not criminals then people on welfare which is also detrimental to society. Now yes, it is possible that some aborted baby would have grown up to be the next Einstein. But since it is more likely that they will end up being detrimental to society, I see no reason why we should assume that the less likely of two outcomes will happen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Women of any age, citizenship status, etc. should be able to get an abortion from any abortion clinic for free, no questions asked.*Reasoning*: In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 ([source](https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2014/06/much-abortion-cost-draft-theresas/)). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. If you oppose a doctor simply informing their patient of the facts, then you oppose spreading knowledge and have no place in any sort of philosophical discussion. If you still do not like the fact that the woman may be more likely to choose abortion when they are more aware of the facts, then maybe you should rethink your position on the matter because when people gain knowledge on the subject they become more likely to disagree with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.*Reasoning*: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.Also not that this is fundamentally different from things such as breastfeeding or a mother simply providing food for her child. Breast milk serves no purpose to the mother, and the nutrients stored in food do not belong to anyone until they consume that food. In this way, a fetus in the womb truly does steal nutrients from the mother. A baby does not steal nutrients from the mother, but rather uses nutrients that were either useless to the mother (breastmilk), or provided by the mother as a gift and therefore never the mother's in the first place.----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.*Reasoning*: This point will probably cause the most controversy. Many people will disagree with this because late in the pregnancy, the fetus would be able to survive on its own if it were surgically removed from the woman in the proper manner. However, I believe that just because it would be able to survive on its own does not change the fact that it is still essentially a parasite and the woman still deserves the right to remove that parasite from her body. The fetus, while in the womb, is still feeding off the nutrients of the mother (regardless of whether or not it could survive outside the womb), and therere should be treated as a parasite.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Things that I do not believe***View*: Women should be forced to have abortions.*Reasoning*: This one is obvious but it must be stated, I do not believe that any woman, for any reason, should EVER be forced into having an abortion. Encouraging them is fine, informing them is fine, forcing them is not.--------------------------------------*View*: A fetus's life is equivalent to a human life*Reasoning*: As I mentioned earlier, I want this discussion to be had with the assumption in mind that fetus's are equivalent to human lives. However, I do not believe this is true. The reason I wish for this to be the assumption is that pro-lifers tend to get hung up on this which I know will lead to a meaningless discussion because I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were **uneqivocally proven** that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to \\"I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way.\\"----------------------------------*View*: All killing is bad*Reasoning*: There are many forms of killing that are generally considered acceptable. Soldiers kill other soldiers in wartime, people are allowed to kill in self-defense, and criminals are executed due to their crimes. All of these are perfectly legal forms of killing, and though some are controversial most would agree that at least one of the three is justified. I believe that abortion is another one of these types of killing. This is also why I don't care whether the fetus is a human or not - I view it as a legally and morally justified form of killing.While I am interested in having my view changed, I am also interested in simply having a discussion on the topic.

"jay520","Firstly, your position is a pro-choice position, it's just a radicalized sort of pro-choice position. For example, atheists who happen to be extreme (e.g. anti-theists) don't stop being atheists.But I don't consider that to be very important. More important is this: the views that you have given thus far could all be given in support of letting unwanted babies die. Do you also hold this view?; Abortions help society....There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies.Everything here also applies to unwanted babies who are already born.; View: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.I assume this is a sort of a bodily autonomy argument. It seems like you're saying something like: women have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. This gives them the right to remove parasites that are attached to their body. Therefore, since fetuses are parasites, women have the right to remove fetuses.A similar bodily autonomy argument can be given to support having the right to let babies die. You could say something like: all people have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. This gives them the right to refuse to care for others. Therefore, people have the right to refuse to care for fetuses (thus letting them die).; View: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.So what you're saying is *even if* the fetus could theoretically survive if the woman went through special surgical procedures, no woman should be forced to go through with this procedure. Instead, women should retain their right to an abortion, even if the baby could be saved (because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy).A similar case can be made for letting babies die. *Even if* a particular baby could theoretically survive if a particular individual went through a special procedure (i.e. by giving the baby to authorities), no individual should be forced to go through with this procedure. Instead, everyone should retain their right to let babies die, even if the baby could be saved (because people have a right to bodily autonomy). In conclusion, everyone should have the right to let babies die, even if the only thing you need to do is give the baby to the authorities. Further, we actually *should* let all unwanted babies die, because it would be good for society. Do you believe this?"
"Rockmar1","&gt; the views that you have given thus far could all be given in support of letting unwanted babies die. Do you also hold this view?I don't, and here is the key difference. A baby that has been born is no longer directly dependent on its mothers nutrients for survival. They could get their nutrients from anywhere. Once the baby is born, giving it up for adoption is a valid option. To tie this in with my views specifically, imagine that tomorrow some technology was invented that allowed people to get fetuses out of themselves, put them in some sort of artificial womb, and let them continue their development there free from the mother. If/when this technology becomes available it will have a drastic effect on my views, but since it is not yet available I see abortion as the best option when you've got a fetus in you that you don't want.; You could say something like: all people have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. This gives them the right to refuse to care for others. Therefore, people have the right to refuse to care for fetuses (thus letting them die).Again, adoption is a thing. We actually DO have the right to refuse to care for a baby if we don't want it and it's already born.So what you're saying is even if the fetus could theoretically survive if the woman went through special surgical procedures, no woman should be forced to go through with this procedure. Instead, women should retain their right to an abortion, even if the baby could be saved (because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy).Yes.... almost. I would completely agree with it if you changed \\"because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy\\" to \\"because aborting unwanted fetuses is generally good for everyone\\".; Further, we actually should let all unwanted babies die, because it would be good for society.Honestly from a 100% pragmatic perspective that's probably true. But that's getting off on a tangent. Keep in mind that one of the biggest differences between a fetus and a born baby is that the born baby does not pose any threat to the mother any longer (as long as she's allowed to give it up for adoption). The same cannot be said for a fetus. If we compare abortion to this hypothetical surgery that would get the baby out, it would matter a lot how risky both options are. I don't know of any such procedure that would be less risky than an abortion. If there were such a procedure that would probably change my view, at least on late term abortions."

So are you against late term abortions or not?; Honestly from a 100% pragmatic perspective that's probably true. But that's getting off on a tangent. Well, it's not getting off on a tangent. I'm testing your views by applying them to actual cases. Not sure how that's tangential. ; Keep in mind that one of the biggest differences between a fetus and a born baby is that the born baby does not pose any threat to the mother any longer (as long as she's allowed to give it up for adoption).

If you are not saying that and if I've mischaracterized you, then please ignore everything that I've said up to this point.---But let's run with this idea that abortions are acceptable *unless* there are other safe alternatives to remove the baby. That is, abortions are *not* acceptable when the fetus can be safely removed without dying (I think this is your view, yes?). Why believe this is the case? It doesn't seem to follow based on what you've said thus far. I'll try to explain why by appealing back to an analogy you used in your OP.In your OP you said \\"*If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.*\\" Presumably you would also say that it's moral to kill a mosquito that's sucking your blood *even if* you have safe methods of removing the mosquito without killing it. Why not say the same about fetuses? You paint fetuses as parasites just like mosquitos. So why not also say: it's moral to abort (and thereby kill) a fetus in your body *even if* you have safe methods of removing the fetus without killing it. A parasite is a parasite (whether it's a fetus or a mosquito) and it doesn't seem morally relevant *how* I choose to remove it. You might say that the difference between the fetus and the mosquito is that the fetus is a person and the mosquito is not...but you have already admitted that you don't believe fetuses are persons (and you don't care if they are persons anyway).---**(I feel that this part of my post is actually more important than everything prior to this point. So feel free to ignore everything before this sentence if/when you respond)**EDIT: Actually hang on a second. In another post you say:; Standard pro-choice is generally focused on the ability for the woman to make a choice for herself (hence the name). Sorta like \\"people should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies -&gt; women are people -&gt; women should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies\\". My view is more focused on the (almost universal) positive aspects of abortion. More like \\"aborting unwanted babies is always a good thing for society -&gt; we should be encouraging people to make choices that benefit society &gt; therefore we should be encouraging people to abort their unwanted babies\\". Women's rights don't really factor into my view, but are a happy side effect.Why can't you say the exact same thing with regard to killing unwanted babies? Why can't you say \\" ~~aborting~~ killing unwanted babies is always a good thing for society -&gt; we should be encouraging people to make choices that benefit society &gt; therefore we should be encouraging people to ~~abort~~ kill their unwanted babies\\". How is this argument not exactly the same? Note that I'm saying *killing* babies, not \\"merely\\" letting them die.Now, you might say that the difference between killing unwanted babies and aborting unwanted fetuses is this: a fetus necessarily hinders the bodily autonomy of its \\"host\\" in a way that babies do not (i.e. you can remove the baby from your life without killing it, unlike a fetus). But, as you say in the above quote, bodily autonomy has nothing to do with your support for abortion; bodily autonomy is, as you say, \\"a happy side effect\\". You are justifying aborting unwanted fetuses by appealing *solely* to the benefits to society. So, again, how does this not support killing unwanted babies?Or, you might say that the difference between killing unwanted babies and aborting unwanted fetuses is this: babies are persons and fetuses are not, thus killing the latter is okay but not the former. But this is not what you believe. You said in your OP that \\"*I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were unequivocally proven that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to 'I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way'.*\\" So you think that killing unwanted fetuses would be okay *even if* fetuses were persons. So clearly you are okay with killing *persons*, so long as it benefits society. Why can't you say the exact same thing about unwanted babies? Why not say: killing unwanted babies benefits society, therefore we should kill unwanted babies - it doesn't matter that they are persons.So I don't see how your views don't also justify killing unwanted babies (not just letting them die, but *killing* them). I can think of two ways to justify abortions without justifying killing babies: by saying that fetuses hinder bodily autonomy, or by saying that fetuses aren't persons. But you have explicitly rejected the relevance of both of these. This, I feel, is the most interesting/important implication of your view. So, I would be okay if you only responded to the parts of my posts dealing with this issue (i.e. the three paragraphs right before this paragraph)."
"almightySapling","&amp;#8710;You put a lot of effort into this response and covered basically every aspect I can think of. I am now totally for killing unwanted babies."
"porkUpine4","Why stop there? Can we kill unwanted children, adults?"
"qvrock","One of the differences is that adults and children can perform self-introspection, while babies can't. This is also one of the biggest differences between humans and animals which people are allowed to kill almost always."
"porkUpine4","Self-introspection is by definition an internal process, with dubious levels of measurability. You're saying the moral right to kill someone is based on how well we determine them to be able to think about themselves?"
"qvrock","Yes that's right. People much less often kill animals that remind people of themselves either behaviorally or by appearance. And killing most of the animals is morally justified (right now). I'm not saying this is a good or a bad thing, it's just how it it is. The only reason why killing babies considered a bad thing is because babies are humans and probably some other artificial moral constructions."
"porkUpine4","So there is no \\"there\\" to the argument. I can kill anyone. I just have to justify (to myself) why I determined that they were not capable of self-introspection."
"qvrock","You can justify any action but it does not necessarily make it beneficial for you (so it's a delusion) or look \\"right\\" to others. What I was talking about is that the selective act of killing babies is not detrimental neither to human race nor to most humans specifically. Animals do that all the time."
"porkUpine4","I still don't see where you're drawing a line between deciding who gets to live or die. However, now you seem to be saying that I can kill a few people of my choice as long as it isn't detrimental to most humans or the human race. So like 4-5% of humans? I can kill those?"
"qvrock","&gt; So like 4-5% of humans? I can kill those?I don't know, you tell me? Or do you want me to suggest (based on what?) a universal mechanism for you to determine whether a particular human/human baby is detrimental or should/should not be killed? My points were a) grown human ≠ human baby, b) killing of animals is somehow justified but killing of newborns is not, c) animals kill some of their spawn and benefit from it. ;I still don't see where you're drawing a line between deciding who gets to live or die. I'm not drawing any lines simply because I don't have any references, therefore I'm neither pro nor contra to this idea. And the whole post was about human babies. Extrapolating the strategy to grown-ups is wrong (in my opinion) simply because unlike newborn, mature humans are almost always self-aware and definitely have both obligations and therefore rights. And to clarify things, I don't think that crippled, disabled and flawed in any other way grown humans should be killed, even if they are a complete burden as long as they are believed to be conscious and don't cause direct harm to others."
"porkUpine4","&gt;as long as they are believed to be conscious and don't cause direct harm to othersBy this standard, to be logically consistent, you wouldn't allow for the killing of newborns or arguably third trimester fetuses."
