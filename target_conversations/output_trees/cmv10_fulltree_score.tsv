0	t3_69us5b	buzzardsgutsman		"I'm playing devils advocate here slightly because I am actually generally pro-choice, but I have thought about the integrity of this particular argument (which from my experience, is the most common one put forward by the pro-choice camp) and found it to be rather questionable.My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children. The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb. However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all. Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice. Thus, parents should be freely able to neglect their children, not provide them with food or comforts, even to the point where their children may die from starvation, and should not face any legal repercussion.Interestingly, some hardcore libertarian ideologies actually do advocate for this, suggesting that child neglect should be legal (anyone who has read Rothbard will be aware). Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical? We don't have to use our body to provide for a foetus because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice, therefore we also don't have to use our body to provide for a child because this is an infringement on bodily autonomy and choice...

(In theory, we have facilities for raising unwanted children. In practice they're not that great, but it's something we can strive for.) Before a child is born, there just isn't any way of preserving both life and liberty (as far as I know). Is it hypocritical to defend a child's life and not the life of a fetus, based solely on what we can and can't do? Maybe, but reality is a bitch sometimes. -Personal opinion (so feel free to criticize anything you see wrong with this): the liberty of \\what am I doing with my time\\"", though a strong one, is still not in the same order of magnitude as the liberty of \\""what am I doing with my body\\"". These are both important, but the latter just somehow feels like it's even more fundamental. Even if we did, as a society, mandate that new parents spend time and effort taking care of their children (which I don't think we do, exactly), it wouldn't necessarily be hypocritical not to say the same for unborn children."""	0.9879051446914673	0.7651702165603638	0.3552805781364441

The life decisions they make are usually made with that in mind, and the same goes for pregnant women. However, the issue is that someone else, who is neither the child nor the expecting mother, wants a say in the decision, and there are just no grounds for that.When you make that decision, you are balancing the life of the embryo against its effects on the body and the life of its mother.

14	t1_dh9qfqz	NinjaRobotClone		"The abortion argument places a lot of importance on Roe v Wade and personhood definitions, but imo the more important precedent for discussing this topic is McFall v Shimp.In short, McFall had a fatal illness which required a bone marrow transfusion. Shimp, his cousin, was the only available match as a donor. Shimp refused to donate, McFall sued him, and the court ruled that Shimp could not be forced to donate his bone marrow to McFall even though McFall would die without it.The judge's ruling in that case was that, even though Shimp's position was morally indefensible, he could not be forced to donate bone marrow against his will because BOY that's a slippery slope. Imagine a cousin you barely know suing you for your kidney and the court telling you that you HAD to give one up to them. Or suing you for a piece of your liver because hey, that grows back, you'll be fine! I don't know about you, but a world where that's the standard sounds pretty horrifying to me.In the case of a fetus, which is a parasite by definition and cannot survive without leeching the host's resources and physically occupying the host's body, you should not be mandated to donate the use of your body to sustain that fetus's life, even though it would die without that. If you can't be forced to donate a kidney to a living child, you shouldn't be forced to donate the use of your womb to a developing fetus.Does this leave room for an argument that legitimizes parental neglect? I can see how you might make that case, but going back to legal precedent, the court CAN force you to relinquish economic resources - ie money - and there exists a legal standard of neglect based on professional duty. Medical malpractice suits are based on this, the idea that doctors have a duty to their patients and failure to meet that standard of care qualifies as neglect. I think you could argue that by choosing to be the guardian of a child (your other options being abortion or surrendering the child for adoption), you are taking upon yourself a certain standard of care.Basically, you're not obligated to donate the use of your body to a developing fetus, but you are obligated to a professional standard of care for children you've chosen to be responsible for.

A (somewhat) better comparison, to me, would be as follows: person A has a bad heart. It functions enough to get by, but it severely lowers their quality if life. They can continue on living like this. Person B is a perfect match and, what do you know, was born with a 2nd heart. This heart, despite not being hooked up to your circulatory system, continues to beat and stay healthy. Upon hearing of Person A, you decide you want to donate that heart to them. The doctors assure you it's little risk and will save a life. They remove Person A's heart. They are now fully dependent on you. You wake up mid surgery and decide you no longer want to donate ths heart, thus allowing Person A to die. Can you justify this scenario?	0.9998041987419128	0.7879753708839417	0.3517416715621948
17	t1_dhap7c2	NinjaRobotClone		I don't think your analogy is apt. Person B has a second heart that is completely vestigial and losing it would have zero impact on their life and functionality. That is not the case for someone who is pregnant.Gestating a human fetus carries a whole host of risks and challenges, not least of which is *death*. Even a perfectly normal low-risk pregnancy with no complications has a serious impact on your quality of life, forces you to take time off of work, puts you through the incredibly exhausting process of childbirth - which in itself can take months to recover from, results in permanent physical changes to your body, and on top of all that *costs you money*. Spending more on food because you're eating more to support the fetus, check-ups with the doctor will still cost you a copay even with the best insurance plans, not to mention the actual cost of childbirth itself which can run you in the tens of thousands of dollars in the US, *easily*. And that doesn't even include the opportunity cost of lost time working.When you factor in potential complications like gestational diabetes, postpartum depression, preeclampsia, etc, there's absolutely no way you can argue that pregnancy is not a significant undertaking.For the record though, your given scenario is exactly why the doctors would take the donor heart *before* beginning surgery on the recipient. Because yes, you absolutely do have that right to suddenly change your mind and refuse in the middle of the procedure.I mean, I would absolutely think that person B was an asshole for doing that, but I'd never try to argue they didn't have that right.	0.12835578620433807	0.3283141851425171	0.41077154874801636

I mean, arguably, it only exists because of the man's actions: if he didn't ejaculate in or around her vagina then she never would've gotten pregnant at all.I don't want to get too far into that because that's a whole other can of worms, but it just irks me when people talk about this as if the man bears no responsibility for the pregnancy.	0.5656998157501221	0.5158027410507202	0.39969611167907715

After the baby is born, he has the right to care for the baby and the responsibility to pay for their care. The woman's situation is the same as the man's after birth, but between fertilization and birth, the woman is the only one with the right to choose to end the pregnancy.So, yeah, the man and the woman are equally culpable for there being a pregnancy to consider aborting (assuming no foul play). However, the woman is the only one with the legal right to decide whether to abort or not, so it doesn't really matter if the man feels horribly guilty about having helped cause a pregnancy or not.	0.2418411374092102	0.45096999406814575	0.44386112689971924

54	t1_dha4ayw	Gladix	32.0	"&gt;My issue with it is this: It seems to work off a presumption that parents, by default, have zero moral obligation towards the welfare of their children.Oh they have. Just not to the undevelopped fetus. Once you went through pregnancy, once the baby properly developed, you have all the obligation in the world to him.;The argument as I understand it states that since a foetus is reliant on its mothers organs to sustain its life, the mother should retain the right to cease \\lending\\"" the use of her organs to the foetus for its survival. That is, if she no longer wants the baby to be able to use her body, she should be able to make that decision, even if the foetus will die as a result of being removed from the womb.Yes, this argument is called bodily autonomy. It's a right every single person has, including corpses. But a right which women in many countries don't have.;However, this only seems to be tenable if we assume that a parent has no moral or social obligation toward the wellbeing and survival of their infant at all.Not really. I mean state can legally execute prisonners, and still has an obligation towards the prisonners before, during and even after they die.; Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice.Nope. Bodily autonomy only extends to use of your own body. Extending the argument defeats THE ENTIRE POINT of bodily autonomy. ;. Most people though, including most pro-choicers, would recoil in disgust at the notion, as society places a burden of care on the parents by default, and any breach in this care is deemed abhorrent. But ultimately, isn't the moral basis for the two actions identical?No, because we are not complete idiots. We understand the difference in age and situation. We understand that a kid 1 year younger, is vastly different than that 1 year older. A kid of 18 year of age is not the same as 15 year of age, and not the same as 2 year old. What you advocating is slippery slope fallacy. Which just doesn't work.Look. Bodily autonomy started as a means of protecting people from being manipulated into giving their bodily freedom away for the \\""common good\\"". Which is horribly missused in a lot of the part of the world. You cannot be ever compelled to give away a liver, a lung a heart. Hell, you can't even give most of these willingly. Not only that, but your corpse also has this right. No ammount of common sense arguments can override your wish of your body not to be used in a certain way. So why is it important to give preference to the bodily autonomy of a woman, rather than the \\""right to live\\"" to the fetus?1, Historically we know that by giving women a freedom from sexual reproduction. The whole society rises and flourishes. You have more mature parents, less teen pregnancies, less divorces, less broken up families, etc...2, Morally giving a woman a right over their own body. Free's them from the biological slavery that is disproportionatelly more harsh on women than it is on men. A woman must undergo a whole series of significant physical, mental and hormonal changes, risk death, and other problems. By saying, we can free you from all of these risks if you don't feel like being forced into having a kid, risk death, risk significant career hurdles, etc... But we won't. Because we feel like the life of a kid is more important than your rights, your body and your life. Does sound pretty abhorent to me.3(side points), At a certain point you need to ancknowledge a certain physical realities. For example. By banning abortion, or making it basically unfeasable for the majority of people. You don't actually reduce the rate of abortions. You actually reduce the rate of safe abortions.;Western Europe has the world's lowest termination rate: 12 a year for every 1,000 women of reproductive age. North America aborts 19 foetuses for every 1,000 women. In South America, where (when the figures were collected) the practice was banned everywhere, the rate was 32. In eastern Africa, it was 38.Not only that, but in countries where abortion is legal only if a woman was raped or had medical emergency. The incident of false rape accusations, and self inflicted harms skyrocketed. Not to mention the suicide rate of women increased.;According to the World Health Organization, about 22 million unsafe abortions are performed every year. This means they are performed by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimal medical standards. The WHO estimates that 47,000 women and girls die every year and another 5 million sustain disabilities due to unsafe abortion.So let's say I grant you all of these. Abortion is wrong morally, it is evil legally. And it's the worst thing that ever happend to our world since Hitler. Even then, having abotion legal is still better, objectively than having it banned. Simply because you will kill less people that way. Both in long and short term.4(side points), Finally the opinions of experts. Medical professionals unanimously agree's that having access to abortion is good for virtually everything. It promotes the very things you want to promote. Statistically the countries where abortion is illegall, are predominantly the worst examples of sexual health, teenage suicides, birth control, condom rates, HIV rates, etc..."""	0.9141943454742432	0.5877186059951782	0.4491216242313385

A 1 week old infant is viable and can sustain all of their own life functions so long as they are provided with the same life requirements that any human requires. Moreover, any adult human (not just the mother) can provide for these requirements to be met, so a mother who doesn't want their 1 week old can give it up and the baby will have it's needs met and can go on to lead a normal, healthy life. Meanwhile, the technology does not yet exist for an 18 week old fetus to survive outside of the one womb they currently reside in. In that sense, they are a parasite against the host (mother).	0.8919185400009155	0.6468071937561035	0.4039233922958374

You are judging the act considering the circumstances around it which is called consequentialism (which also has the concept of \\""greater good\\""). When you define the morality of the consequence based on pain and pleasure that offshoot is called hedonism. The word has a negative connotation but its not what you think and itself has many sub categories (such as negative hedonists which believe that pleasure if a form of vice because the consequence leads to wanting more things and being less happy so they try and remove all pleasure).So what is the point? Well the major camps for morality are the deontologists and the consequentialists. And whenever you hear someone say \\""i can see both sides of the argument\\"" 9 times out of 10 those are the two sides. That dynamic is also a popular theme in movies (a recent prominent example is Vin Diesel in Fast and Furious movies is a strict deontologist who's often at odds with other consequentialists protagonists).

110	t1_dhcbwb1	CoyotePatronus	11.0	&gt;Extending this logic, we should also argue that a parent should not be forced to provide for a young child, as this would also be just as much an infringement of bodily autonomy and personal choice.And here is where it falls apart. Medical bodily autonomy is not the same as 'bodily autonomy because I have to physically move my body to accomplish the task'.Even if you consider the fetus and the newborn infant are exactly the same, the newborn infant is also not allowed to violate the mother's medical bodily autonomy without her permission. She is not obligated to give it blood, organs, tissue, etc. Neglect is not in the same category.One is the condition of a human being of *any* stage of development making direct medical use of another human being's physical body- draining resources, utilizing organs, tissues, and blood, utilizing space within the body, or otherwise permanently medically impacting the body, *without permission*. No one is allowed to do this, not even to save their own life, save very rarely and under very specific circumstances...not even if the body in question is deceased.	0.9700609445571899	0.6740390658378601	0.4254726767539978

Ultimately, I think if you're using a completely black &amp; white ideological argument to support bodily autonomy in pregnancy (saying a woman should be able to rescind her obligation absolutely anytime), you have to use the same standard for parenting as a whole, in which case child neglect should be legal. If you're starting to throw pragmatic elements into it, then its only fair you do the same for pregnancy/abortion, in which case I can only conclude that abortion shouldn't be allowed.	0.651272177696228	0.5800002217292786	0.419849693775177

Would it be ok for the state to give a gun to each child that had a 0.0185% chance of killing their mother?This is an absurd hypothetical, but my point is to illustrate active vs passive behavior in ethical situations. In pregnancy, there is a real chance of dying, and having real suffering and medical difficulties if you 'passively' carry a child to term. As a parent, there is no chance of dying or suffering medical difficulties (barring social resistance and psychological effects) if you 'passively' neglect your infant.	0.6056925654411316	0.6507737636566162	0.3382178246974945

If the technology existed such that we could remove the fetus without killing it, then I'd agree with a law that required using that and giving it up instead of killing the fetus. But since we do not have that technology, the fetus still doesn't have any right to use the women's body without her consent.; If you're starting to throw pragmatic elements into it, then its only fair you do the same for pregnancy/abortion, in which case I can only conclude that abortion shouldn't be allowed.How does saying a woman rescind her obligation at any time translate to child neglect being legal? In the case of a child, in order to rescind her obligations she must ensure the child is taken care of by *someone* ie: giving it up for adoption, dropping it at a safe haven, etc. In the case of a fetus, the woman's right to her own body trumps any rights you may assign to the fetus which most would argue does not have the same rights as a child.	0.5692517161369324	0.5311959385871887	0.3508256673812866

Like I said, you are bringing a pragmatic element in here: A parent can rescind their obligation to take care of their child as it is their choice, but since neglecting it outright wouldn't be a very nice thing to do, they should make sure it is taken care of first.I don't see how it's any different to say that a woman can rescind her right to take care of a foetus as it is her choice, but since crushing it with a pair of forceps and pulling it piece by piece out of her body isn't very nice, she should wait till the foetus can survive outside her and then give it to someone else to care for.	0.9996743202209473	0.6666380167007446	0.4709863066673279
132	t1_dh9ssgr	z3r0shade	46.0	The difference is whether or not she has to risk her own life, health, and wellbeing. It's a conflict of rights. In the case of a child having to be dropped off or given up for adoption, the child has a right to life and the mother does not have to risk her own health, well-being and potentially her life in order to give it up for adoption, as such the child's right to not be abused trumps her right to neglect it. In the case of a fetus, it has no right to the woman's body and has no right to continue to use her body nor the right to force her to risk her life for it. It's the exact same reason why we can arrest a parent for neglecting their child until it starves but we can't legally force them to donate an organ to their dying child	0.717428982257843	0.5464873313903809	0.41385984420776367

135	t1_dhahci7	RMSOT		But you are weighing 'forced donation' against a human life. I bet you make the exact opposite argument for socialized healthcare. The child is only party that did not consent. Sex carries a risk of pregnancy, a cost paid for by both consenting parties (enforced by courts). We can mitigate that risk as much as possible, but once it becomes a matter of lifestyle vs life (ie, pregnancy happens) you can't possibly morally defend that. You do not have the moral authority to decide that someone would be better off not existing.

136	t1_dhaijrv	klemnodd		I am not arguing morality (I somewhat agree with you) I was stating that that was a good analogy.

Yes I am for socialism but I don't view it as a forced donation (because that assumes the belief that your true effort is valued more than others, we are not born equal).

Life is risk/reward, and that's okay. If you didn't assume any risk, you would never want to leave the house. However when you start altering the risk/reward by infringing on the rights of other, its immoral. Banks did this in 2008, private reward, socialized risk. Student loans, same thing, the government guarantees them so why not loan out to the world? In this case, you are eliminating the risks by killing the fetus.

If I had to I could pragmatically agree on outlawing abortion after the 1st trimester. Why am I concerned? Because the fundamental role of a government in a free society is to protect against others infringing on natural rights of life, liberty and property. Therefore, the government does have a role in stopping thieves, murders, slavers, and abortionists. Maybe I connected things a little loosely. Socialism is socialized risk, private upside. Socializing risk is roughly equivalent to removing it (you are one small data point), tragedy of the commons. I can treat my body like a turd, eat lots of shitty food and socialize the cost of consequences. From this I draw that cheating the risk/reward ratio by use of government (socialized) or by infringing on the rights of others ('legal stealing' or 'legal murder, late term abortion') is immoral.	0.004681331571191549	0.3301754593849182	0.3877655267715454

In other words, there is a non-zero percent chance of her health and maybe even life getting hurt.The reality is that the chances of her life and health being injured by taking the child to an adoption center are so small as to be negligible and aren't directly caused or a result of doing so but are the normal risks associated with leaving ones house. It's not a valid comparison.; Is it acceptable to force these risks on the mother? If they are, does that mean that the mother should be forced to give birth as long as the risks associated with pregnancy are lowered to some predetermined level?Yes, if pregnancy magically did not require 9 months of a woman having a medical condition that has risks of killing her or severely injuring her, among the risks associated with giving birth and so on, then we wouldn't be having such a huge issue with forcing women to carry a pregnancy. But since that is reality, I fail to see how such a hypothetical is relevant. ; This case needs to be argued for, because the fetus is in this situation due to the actions of the mother.First of all, why the actions of the mother and not the actions of the father? Second of all, no. If you hit someone with a car, you are legally liable for their injuries but guess what? We still do not legally require you to donate an organ to them if they require it and you're a match because bodily autonomy is seen as more important. Even if they will die if you don't donate an organ.; By doing something, I get a lot of pleasure, but I know there is a 50% chance of you becoming dependent of me to survive.Not a valid comparison, a fetus is not a pre-existing individual.

The parent still needs to use her body to feed the child, especially if we're talking about breastfeeding. It's called bodily autonomy, not organ autonomy.But we're not talking about breastfeeding. There are plenty of ways to feed a child that don't involve breastfeeding. Organs are inside of your body right? Thus bodily autonomy. The principled distinction is the difference between having to take an action (use money to get food to feed a child) vs force you to undergo an operation that carries significant risk to your health, or remove a part of your body.	0.9510190486907959	0.666981041431427	0.4279463291168213

By taking a risk, you are very clearly consenting at least to the possibility of the negative outcome. If you clearly did not want it to happen, you'd not take the risk.	0.0548044852912426	0.45535072684288025	0.47434002161026
187	t1_dhamjz9	aceytahphuu		&gt;In regards to the law, I think the law should change. The status quo of the law is not a justification for abortion any more than legalized death penalty justifies the death penalty.This is pretty interesting. Just to verify that you're sincere and aren't just being an internet edgelord, do you genuinely believe that a person found to be at fault for causing a car accident where the other party is severely injured should be forced to donate their organs to the injured party?	0.7919427752494812	0.6361580491065979	0.2764730155467987
188	t1_dhaq1c0	MnemonicFitness		No, because I don't consider abortion to be equivalent to organ donation. I do believe that the person at fault does have a duty to rescue the injured party - like donate blood, if there are no alternatives. I think refusing to donate blood in this instance and telling the injured party just to die off is morally unjust.	0.9997444748878479	0.9997691512107849	0.00011655689013423398
189	t1_dhag11r	z3r0shade	46.0	"&gt; If you take the position that abortion should be allowed regardless of whether the fetus is a person or not, then arguing about the personhood of the fetus is irrelevant. Why waste time arguing over the personhood of the fetus, when at the end of the day you support abortion even if the fetus were a fully fledged person?Certain arguments work better with certain people based on their views and personal bias. If someone would support abortion if not for their belief in the personhood of the fetus, it's easier to argue personhood than change their view on the ethics of abortion, or vice versa.; The status quo of the law is not a justification for abortion any more than legalized death penalty justifies the death penalty.I was using law and donating organs as an example of my point, not as the point itself. Do you believe we should force a parent who is a match to their child to donate their organs if required to safe the life of the child? Should we require a person who accidentally causes another person harm to the point that they need an organ transplant to have their organ transplanted to safe the person's life?; There is no causal relation here. You driving on the road does not cause them to drive into you.By definition they drove into me because I chose to drive despite knowing the risks. The argument you made was that since I undertook an action, knowing the risks, I have consented to all negative consequences. By definition choosing to drive means I have done this and according to you have consented to being hit. If you want to argue causality, that's an entirely different argument.; If I put a bullet in an 8 chamber revolver, spin it and then shoot someone, my claims of not consenting to kill someone would no way absolve me of my crime.How is that in any way comparable to choosing to have sex and having an abortion? Notice no one is claiming that choosing to have sex doesn't mean you are responsible for the outcome, the woman has to choose to either carry the pregnancy or have an abortion, either way she has to deal with the consequences of her actions. Getting an abortion doesn't \\absolve her of responsibility\\"" for getting pregnant."""	0.45905402302742004	0.46244749426841736	0.4519965946674347

193	t1_dhajwf3	LickABoss1		The fundamental difference is that, while children can be transferred to different parents if the current parents don't want to or cannot care for them, a fetus in a womb cannot be transferred to a different womb if a mother doesn't want to or cannot birth the child. In addition, child neglect doesn't fall under body autonomy because the child consciously suffers from any neglect, while an aborted fetus feels nothing as it lacks consciousness, and doesn't even have the capability to feel anything until something like 23 weeks.	0.8955289125442505	0.8955289125442505	0.1042584478855133
194	t1_dhakgey	buzzardsgutsman		Bodily autonomy is not conditional on options, at least not when you take an absolute stance on it like pro-choicers do. You can choose to either provide for another individual or not.Bodily autonomy is also not conditional on suffering. Otherwise, we could force people to donate kidneys to people who were suffering from renal failure. A right to do what you want with your body is not affected by the circumstances of other individuals around you.	0.4647683799266815	0.42893069982528687	0.3823496401309967
195	t1_dhalfd9	LickABoss1		I don't disagree with either statement. What I meant was that it's wrong to neglect a child not because people shouldn't have a choice about whether to care for a child, but because there are other services that can be used to avoid suffering of the child if the parents choose not to care for a child. Abortion is a different matter because no alternative service exists to take care of an unwanted pregnancy, so to not allow abortion would be to cut off body autonomy. An example to prove my point: Jill doesn't want to care for her infant son Jeremy. Foster care and adoption exist, so that enables Jill to keep bodily autonomy without inflicting unnecessary suffering on Jeremy. Example two: Jill is pregnant with Jeremy and doesn't want to give birth to him. There is no alternative way to maintain Jill's bodily autonomy, so abortion is the only option.	0.9121894240379333	0.7136490941047668	0.3380635976791382
