With this said, a common argument I see against pro lifers is that it is sexist to outlaw abortions, because it's wanting control of a woman's body. While I agree with the premise of it- that the government shouldn't decide what people do to themselves, I don't think that most pro lifers oppose abortion because it would give a woman bodily autonomy, but because they believe that babies are separate entities from their mother who deserve life. Abortion is a super grey area. You've got people who think that as soon as a sperm and egg meet, it's murder to stop them. But you've also got people who think that a baby isn't a life form until it leaves the womb. I think both sides ultimately have good intentions, even if they're crazy and extreme about it. CMV!"

Consider [this image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C7n2dJAX0AEoeXX.jpg) of Republican lawmakers making decisions on their party's healthcare bill (which of course includes decisions on birth control), and notice that there are literally zero women on this committee. The point many people (myself included) make when they say that being pro-life is sexist is not that feminists aren't allowed to be pro-life - they're mainly pointing out the tone-deafness of a group of people who will never be able to be pregnant making decisions regarding something they'll never personally experience."

It is a health bill law, not a meeting about abortion, nor the legality of abortion. This group of people are meeting to figure out how shit gets paid for. Yes, how abortion gets paid for is part of it, but token women are not really the answer. This is a meeting of people who were elected by the people, not an open debate about abortion. Second point is that they do have to answer to their constituents, which are both male and female. That is how government works, we elect those people to sit there and pass laws that we want passed.

It's not as a result of hatred towards women, but as a result of a strong conviction and belief in that consumation is when the \\"soul\\" enters life. Now, I think it's ridiculous to base laws on undocumented claims such as that, and I agree that the consequences are terrible, but I don't think it's hatred.The one mistake I see people make when entering a debate or a discussion on allmost every topic, especially the most controversial ones is that they are assuming negative intent. Pro-lifers assume pro-choicers have no regard for life, while pro-choicers assume pro-lifers wants to control women for the sake of controlling women.I don't know if this adds to the conversation or not, but it is a healthy piece of advice how I see it.

At the time when women gained the right to vote it had to be legislated by a heterogeneous legislature. I think it is a silly argument that if there is a disproportionate sex or race represented in the legislative body, that body must be sexist. It assumes that humans can't empathize and are inherently amoral. Furthermore, the majority of the electoric is female and they pick their representative. So unless they have no agency I don' see the issue. Finally, the reason why congress has to regulate birth control is because its subsidized. If the gov doesn't pay for it then it doesn't need to be regulated."
"t1_dgawhv0"	"berrieh"	"20"	"The argument with legislation against abortion (\\"being against\\" is too broad a phrase; one can be against something, yet not want to legislate it) being sexist is complicated. It has several components: 1) Despite growing equity, legislators are still predominantly male. This leads to a bunch of men passing legislation that only affects women's bodies. Men controlling what women do with their bodies has some inherent sexism to it, even if sexism isn't the *goal*.2) Additionally, much of the legislation involved seeks to limit other forms of birth control (and funds to provide them freely) that would reduce the need for abortions. Considering that birth control is the primary reason that the feminist revolution was able to happen, this is key. If women cannot control their reproduction, equality is essentially impossible. As far as I know, none of these people have proposed ways to maintain equality (can we research keeping zygotes viable outside the mother? can we secure funding for every woman who is pregantant, give them workplace protections that are absolute, and give everyone free daycare so that bearing children has 0 economic impact? Can we provide free and symptom-free birth control?) while taking abortion away and many have done the opposite. They don't seem to just want to end abortion because they're sad about the zygote or whatever (though that is the line they use) but also to want to actively imprison women as the vehicle for childbirth seeing that as the \\"natural order\\" of things. That's sexism and it's the foundation of sexism, I would argue. I think sexism and gender stereotypes are essentially formed around the biology of human reproduction. If men were the ones who bore children, women would have fought wars and lead industries for centuries. IF both bore children, maybe equality would be natural and not hard won. Who knows? 3) Women are ultimately the only ones affected by such laws at the end of the day, thus it is clearly a woman's issue. At the end of the day, these laws represent discrimination against women on the basis of sex. The fact that this is due to something we haven't yet tackled to change about biology (no one has attempted to alter the biological means of human reproduction sufficiently, really, so we don't know if it could be done) doesn't mean that these laws are not solely leveled against women on the basis of their sex. 4) For the most part, the same people who are advocates of LAWS that are anti-choice (and many people are \\"pro-life\\" without wanting to limit reproductive freedom, actually) are advocating a traditional mindset. They're not interested in outside-the-box solutions to the issue of the zygote, as I said above. They don't care about the impact it would have on women, at best, and sometimes would be happy with women in a more traditional role. To not consider women's rights while restricting them for other reasons is also sexist. I have yet to see an anti-choice law proposed with any provisions that protect women in any way, shape, or form, from the natural sexism of forcing women to bear children when they do not want to do so. 5) And the largest one: At the end of the day, participating in institutional decisions (like laws) that we fundamentally know lead to sexist results = sexism. My personal aversion to anti-choice laws actually has nothing to do with sexism and everything to do with bodily autonomy (male or female, no one should tell you that you must donate a kidney, carry an organism to term that cannot be self-supporting, etc), but I also think such things are more rooted in sexism than you suggest."

The women who vote for those men with pro life stances are pro life. Women dont uniformly agree on abortion so this argument is irrelevant. They are representing women who voted for them.;3) Women are ultimately the only ones affected by such laws at the end of the day, thus it is clearly a woman's issue. Im sure the men whose children get aborted without their consent would disagree they were not affected, or the potential life that was there. You are choosing to only see the female's side here, and willfully ignoring at least one other if not two other people involved. 5) And the largest one: At the end of the day, participating in institutional decisions (like laws) that we fundamentally know lead to sexist results = sexism.this is a tautology and its not even provable the laws are sexist you just see them as such."

As to laws against abortion, I'm speaking as one analyzing laws. A law could be written that wasn't sexist and was anti-choice in theory (it would have to provide mitigation for the sexist repercussions of anti-choice legislation, but one has never been and I doubt one ever would be because the basis of being anti-choice in practicality is almost always anti-feminist as well). The most logical choice if you feel a moral imperative for a zygote would be to pursue science that allows them to gestate without a human being needed as an incubator. Yet I am willing to bet that in the majority of cases, anti-choice people are the last people who would support such research being federally funded. ;We can imagine a world where both men and women could give birth.

Pro-abortion anti-contraceptives is a possible combination. Perhaps not likely, but possible.Absolutely. That was only one of my subpoints and based on existing legislation attempts. For instance, someone who supports/proposes legislation that far expands birth control availability and research into more equitable means of BC (i.e. cost-free and symptom-free for women, as well as 100%) as a means to reduce and eventually ban abortion would probably not be sexist, but this is not the means in which most people want to ban abortion. Most legislation is anti-women and anti-sex, and anyone supporting anti-choice legislation is supporting that, whether it's their goal/intent or not. ;I agree, however we currently live in a world without one and so that's the situation we have to deal with.

One could certainly believe pro-choice and be against federal funding, pro-life and against, pro-choice and for, or pro-life and for.Right, and the only way to live with it that is not sexist is to allow women to maintain bodily autonomy. ;I can't speak for everyone, but in my view, he fundamental problem with abortion has to do with the morality of killing a human being. That problem remains irrespective of who carries the children.The last sentence holds no meaning because \\"who carries the children\\" is not changeable at the moment. It's very easy to say \\"ifs\\" that will never be true. There are inherently sexist outcomes to every anti-choice position (legislatively) that can currently exist, therefore being legislatively anti-choice is sexist. Being morally opposed to abortion personally is obviously a different issue. But being FORCED to potentially be a human incubator (whose body and career could also be ruined by that forced event) OR deny your sexuality as a human (the 2 options women are left with, with our current level of science) being because of your gender is an inherently a sexist outcome. And ultimately, supporting a sexist outcome is sexist and thus makes you sexist, whether that is the primary intent or not."

From my standpoint, the only position I've heard for anti-choice people is either idiocy in regards to ethics or sexism. I don't think there are other options.

I feel like it's a reasonable line to draw in the sand (and in fact is the line Judith Jarvis Thompson draws in her essay on abortion).I've chosen to entirely disregard the argument on \\"when life begins\\" because it is entirely unproductive. I fully cede that life begins at conception because it is logically consistent and doesn't require guesswork on the part of humans to arbitrarily decide what life *is*. It still has absolutely no bearing on the right of a mother to have control over her own body, especially from a legal standpoint, and it still defends the ethical implications of almost every single case of abortion.I'm quite secure in the consistency of my philosophy on abortion. If we are someday able to more accurately determine personhood, I would absolutely be able to better shape my philosophy.

Congratulations, you found a case I won't defend.If a person is either a) unaware of the consequences of intercourse or b) takes appropriate precautions to prevent pregnancy they are not morally culpable for the creation of new life.I'll give you an example (which is roughly taken from Judith Jarvis Thompson's famous essay, admittedly). Say someone owns a home. They go out of the house for a few hours, leaving the doors unlocked and the windows open, fully aware that they may be burgled. When they return home, their house has been robbed. A reasonable observer would say there is some amount of culpability on the homeowner not to secure their belongings in any way with full knowledge they may be taken. Now suppose we have someone who also owns a home. But when they go out of the house, they make sure to lock the doors and windows. They return home to a burgled house. What reasonable observer would claim this person was at fault in any way for being robbed? You may say, \\"Well they should have had an alarm.\\" Perhaps that's true but is that a *reasonable* expectation to have of someone to protect their valuables. I would say no. In the same way, if a woman practices reasonable birth control practices that are known to work in the vast majority of cases, there is no reasonable expectation of the woman to get pregnant. As for those uneducated, I'm sure you can figure the analogy out (for example a person who was never taught to lock the doors and windows when leaving -&gt; someone who was not educated about effective birth control practices; very common in the US).;And let's be honest, this whole \\"nutrients\\" shit, it's to mask the convenience. It's an inconvenient thing to have a baby, and when someone gets pregnant but they're not in a 100% perfect spot for it (hint: nobody ever is), they think \\"eh, better murder it than lose on all that new year's booze\\".

Why did you think this was something necessary to type?;And even worse is this pseudo-scientific argument for \\"body and nutrients\\", like it even begins to justify the murder of a human being.Ah yes, the most basic assertion of the rights of man, the right to bodily autonomy is just \\"pseudo-scientific argument for body and nutrients,\\" you caught me. Have you actually ever grappled with philosophy or are you only capable of emotional reactions to this issue? The fact that you insist on calling it \\"baby murder\\" (which does not accurately convey the meaning of what is happening) makes it abundantly clear that your position is emotional and not ethical. Ethics aren't \\"how you feel\\" about something, it is a set of assertions on right and wrong in the world that follow a consistent, logical set of axioms.Tell me: do people have a right to bodily autonomy in general? Does a woman have a right to bodily autonomy? Is a person obligated to allow someone else to use their body for the purpose of living? If you were to awake tomorrow hooked up to a dying man to allow him to live, would you be ethically obligated to stay attached to him? These are the ethical questions that must be answered. Crying \\"baby murder\\" isn't an argument, it's an emotional response, a response that doesn't stand up to logical scrutiny."

Maybe for your next answer you only refer to pro-life as \\"people who think women have no rights\\" and see how that argument sells for ya. Stupid suggestions get stupid responses.Using this one for measure. I'm not attacking you as a person, I'm aiming at your arguments. Pleare refrain from attacking my person.And also, you didn't do it, so neither shall I.; If a person is either a) unaware of the consequences of intercourse or b) takes appropriate precautions to prevent pregnancy they are not morally culpable for the creation of new life.Ok, we are assuming someone in reproductive age doesn't know that having sex leads to pregnancy. Alright, way down we go. If someone is in the age of having intercourse (i.e., they're over the consent age [I know people have sex before that, but even then, come on]) it is only logical to assume they know that sex makes babies. You cannot be in the age of thinking about rolling in the hay with the pretty ladies and still believe in the magical stork that brings babies to married couples. And, as I said in the first post, no one is ever ready to have a baby - and the contraceptive methods are written *in the containers* that they're not 100% efficient. There are only three methods of intercourse that are 100% efficient: not penetrating, not penetrating the vagina, and not having sex. If you're having sex, and you are in a biological position to have a chance to get pregnant, there is still a chance. ; I'll give you an example (which is roughly taken from Judith Jarvis Thompson's famous essay, admittedly).This example equates the home being robbed to a woman getting pregnant, one that is taking precautions, and the other who isn't. What I find hard to swallow for the argument to go full circle is that, in the end, no one inside the house dies! I mean, if we're equating a robbery to an abortion, why don't you talk about the part where the baby dies? Is it because **it's unethical to kill a baby for convenience?**; None of this is a cogent argument for anything just your own musings on why people do thingsWho are you to say it isn't a part of it? I'm not saying it's 100% of the cases (it obviously isn't) but, if you're talking about people that don't even know sex makes babies (as if), then surely you must be able to see that some people would have an abortion not to miss a party, or not to lose out on their early 20's, or to keep fit, or to keep their night-job at the local club, or whatever. Again, unethical reasons to kill a baby. And, from what I've seen on Reddit threads about the subject, Reddit doesn't like it when people that work with abortions ask the mother about the baby, and/or try to dissuade her. ; Have you actually ever grappled with philosophy or are you only capable of emotional reactions to this issue?Have you ever grappled with the ethics of ending a human life, and how do you feel about defending someone's right to murder someone else, or are you only capable of screaming \\"ETHICS\\" to anyone who comes near?; The fact that you insist on calling it \\"baby murder\\" (which does not accurately convey the meaning of what is happening) Two questions:1. Is the fetus growing inside of you a human fetus?2. If you don't attempt against its life, will it come out of your womb as a baby human?; Tell me: do people have a right to bodily autonomy in general? Does a woman have a right to bodily autonomy? Is a person obligated to allow someone else to use their body for the purpose of living? If you were to awake tomorrow hooked up to a dying man to allow him to live, would you be ethically obligated to stay attached to him?Can you seriously, no-joke, 100% not see the difference between being randomly hooked up to a machine (if I'm waking up to it, it's probably against my will, the one abortion I agreed with - the one in case of rape), and you actively taking a decision that has a chance of leading to pregnancy? Where do you draw your \\"bodily autonomy\\" line? If someone touches your shoulder without written permission, will you cut their hand off? It's your body, they can't invade it. We aren't discussing the case of a woman getting \\"hooked up to a dying man\\" (sic), we're talking about a woman growing a life inside of her! A life that's half-her! How can you say this is ethical? It certainly is moral - anything is. But ethical? From the wiki: [Ethics or moral philosophy is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics). Ethics is the main branch, it's the example from which the morals of the people spread. I can't call someone \\"immoral\\" without having an ideal ethical code to follow (Plato's perfect being reflects this). So, your notion of \\"ethical\\" places a woman's right to \\"bodily autonomy\\" (against her own child) over the child's right to life. Is that ehtical?; Crying \\"baby murder\\" isn't an argument, it's an emotional response, a response that doesn't stand up to logical scrutiny.[INB4: Reductio ad hitlerum, I know.] Then I guess saying \\"jew murder\\" was an emotional response, not an argument. I mean, the Germans had a right to spacial autonomy, and those Anne Franks were, like, invading their space. That argument's rubbish, but it's necessary to show that it's almost the same thing."

Bodily autonomy isn't about whether or not someone touches your shoulder (though it might become so if you said \\"please don't touch my shoulder\\" and they continued to do so). It's about you being the sole decider of what your body does and where it goes and what goes into it (food, medicine, other people's body parts).

If you follow the comment chain, the only rape[edit: the only abortion] I tolerate is the one in case of rape. Or, obvious, when the pregnancy threatens the woman's life. And that's where I draw the \\"bodily autonomy\\" line. If you are having a baby, it's because you took the decision to have sex, the one thing that leads to babies. Unless you didn't make the decision to have sex, or the pregnancy might actually kill or seriously harm you, then you should not be able to murder a human being on any pretext, be it convenience, bodily autonomy, religion, desire, whatever.

I assume you acknowledge that, in the case of rape, the damage the pregnancy does to the mother is not necessarily physical but mental. I appreciate that, thank you. Rape is not the only instance when pregnancy can \\"be a potential damage on the mother that goes far beyond itself.\\" Most women who have abortions already have at least one child and are worried about their financial and emotional ability to care for another child. I suspect you'd argue that those women can simply give their children up for adoption, but carrying a baby to term and then giving it up can be incredibly emotionally traumatizing. It used to be very common for young girls and unwed mothers to be forced to give birth and then give their children up (I'd suggest reading [Beggars and Choosers](https://www.amazon.com/Beggars-Choosers-Politics-Adoption-Abortion/dp/0809028603) if that aspect interests you are all). And simply being pregnant can be emotionally and physically traumatic. A dear friend of mine is pregnant right now (7 mos) and she had a blood clot, which not only almost killed her, but made her a high risk pregnancy. She's been in physical pain for most of her pregnancy, struggled with nausea, and is now worried about any future pregnancies. The reality is that the prospect of being pregnant and having a child that you cannot care for is, in itself, traumatic. There are lasting repercussions and damages, not only to the mother and the child, but any other children the woman may have. Women know these repercussions and damages, and have in the past done may terrifying, dangerous, and illegal things to avoid them. That's the world we return to when we outlaw abortion. If we truly want fewer abortions, we should focus on providing everyone with a living wage so poor women can raise their kids. We need affordable child care for everyone so working women can provide for their kids, we need paid parental leave so parents don't have to worry about losing their jobs if they become unexpectedly pregnant. We need universal health care so poor women can get pre- and post-natal care and so their children can get the care they need, and any children with physical or mental disabilities can get the care they need. We need comprehensive, sex-positive sex education so that couples understand how pregnancy does and doesn't happen and can effectively avoid it. And we need safe, legal, and accessible abortion providers so that women don't die trying to get illegal abortions."

No, we don't need universal healthcare for that. We need *affordable* health care. And the best way to make something affordable in a capitalist system is **not** by paying for it with Government money (or, as Margaret Thatcher put it, \\"your money\\"), it is by letting people compete between themselves. If we pay for it, people make it more and more expensive, because hey, the Government will pay whatever I charge. And, boom!

An adult should always be prepared for sex, to defend himself against STD's, and to prevent unwanted pregnancies. This is the solution. If we make condoms and pills the norm, unwanted pregnancies will plummet. And, no, not all pro-lifers are die-hard catholics that don't want people using condoms.; And we need safe, legal, and accessible abortion providers so that women don't die trying to get illegal abortions.So, to have fewer abortions, we need a safer, more accessible, possibly way cheaper mode of aborting, that doesn't do even the slightest background check (even gun stores do it, c'mon!), doesn't account for past abortions, just goes around lining up babies for murder like it's Christmas at the murder factory? No! No way! For less abortions, we need to make sure the only people that can get an abortion are the people that absolutely, 100%, no \\"financial\\" or \\"bodily autonomy\\" bullshit **need** an abortion!

Before viability, this means the fetus stops developing and doesn't survive; the fetus never had the capacity to live on its own before that point anyway.If we use the example of the violinist (where you awake to find yourself hooked up to a dying violinist and only if you stay attached to him will he survive), the insinuation of abortion is that you kill the man and then detach yourself. The reality of abortion is that you're unhooking yourself and the man subsequently dies because he could not live on his own.

But in the vast majority of cases (&gt;99%), there is a logical argument to be made about the permissibility of abortion that follows a consistent ethical framework. The pro-life argument doesn't argue against it from a different ethical framework, though. It relies on misconstruing the nature of abortion entirely by shifting passive death to active killing.

"t1_dgb2z2o"	"unorocks"	"1"	"I'm a lawyer, so I know about duty of care as a legal term of art and have studied it in that context, but I appreciate the condescension. We don't apply duty of care to patients, and we don't apply a duty of reasonable care to children in the womb. No patient has another duty of care toward another patient to provide them with lifesaving procedures or tools. Even after death, we recognize the autonomy of the deceased, which is why doctors cannot and will not harvest organs from a dead person unless there is an explicit directive made by the deceased to that effect. Your analogy about the car ride with a driver and passengers does not apply because we don't apply the duty of care framework to medical decisions made by patients. Edit: to address your point that there should be a duty of care towards a fetus - I think that's a dangerous proposition. There's been legislation introduced in certain states that would require investigations into women who suffer miscarriages due to suspicion that they were actually abortions. This interferes significantly with a woman's right to privacy in her medicinal decisions and, on a personal level, further traumatizes women who suffer miscarriages of wanted children and penalizes women who don't necessarily grieve their miscarriages. There's similar legislation for pregnant women who abuse drugs or alcohol, which, whatever you think of pregnant women and addiction, I'm sure most people can agree that the best help in a number of these situations is not fines, jail time, or termination of parental rights, but social support and rehabilitation programs. At what point would a duty of care towards a fetus be adequate? Our culture prizes children, but rarely provides societal infrastructure to support children and parents (especially those in low socioeconomic classes). Additionally, duty of care towards a fetus would pretty firmly establish that fetuses (and potentially - embryos) have personhood rights, which would have grave implications for abortion laws and scientific research."

We can both easily understand why you're examples are nonapplicable and why my passenger example is a better analogy.The rest of your post is a red herring. Birth is not analogous to a patient-to-patient relationship. That's nonsense. Birth is a situation where someone has taken another life form under their direct care. This is more akin to a doctor-to-patient relationship. Or as I explained, a driver-to-passenger relationship. Is that not clearly obvious?"

How is it that a woman has a duty of care toward a fetus, but a brother has no duty of care toward his sister with cancer when he is the only person in the world who can provide her with a lifesaving transplant? I would argue this analogy is more on point since (1) the sister's life is entirely dependent on the brother's choice to continue with the transplant and (2) it takes the hypo back into a medical setting, which is more appropriate than a driver-passenger analogy for the purposes of examining the duty of care."
"t1_dgb6bak"	"MMountain_"	NA	"My position isn't that there is existing law, only that we can draw analogies to other situations and that the initial comparison you made to an organ donor is a false equivalence because there is no assumption of a duty of care. There's no need to establish that the law recognizes such a duty if its my position that we should *change policy* and begin recognizing a duty. Bear in mind that I'm not necessarily taking that position, only making the argument that the recognition of such a duty would fall within our ordinary understanding of a duty of care. In short, conceptualizing the mother-to-fetus relationship as one of a duty of care towards the fetus by the mother who has taken a volitional act towards creating a dependence of the fetus on her, we can plausibly posit that she should owe a duty of care.Moreover, this particular factual scenario would be hard to try as a case. It would likely require the father to sue on behalf of his unborn child. I doubt he would even have standing. It would have to be new legislation.Can we at least agree that unlike the donor example, a mother (leaving out fringe examples such as rape) has taken some affirmative acts that have led to her having a person in her body? If so, can we further agree that these sort of actions, are the types of actions that in some cases can lead to the creation of a duty of care?To respond directly to your second edit, I would say the difference is that the brother has not undertaken any affirmative action towards creating a duty of care towards the sister. Its not a matter of whether or not she is dependent on him, its a matter of whether he has assumed a duty of care.We can change your example a bit to create a more close question of whether a duty has been created. Suppose he had promised to provide the organ and the sister had detrimentally relied on that promise. Let's say she has already gone under the knife and had her defective organ removed. At some point during the surgical process I would argue the brother has reached a point of no return and now owes the kidney because the sister has detrimentally relied on the promise of the kidney.The other common law school example in this situation is the guy drowning in the river. Once the rescuer begins to take affirmative steps towards rescuing and the drowning party has taken acts to his detriment or peril, a duty is established. Whereas the would-be-rescuer owes no duty when he has taken no action."

While other people see the right to bodily autonomy as the most fundamental right, trumping even the right to life. So when you have a situation where the two rights are on conflict, people will disagree. But I you look at it, neither of these rights are necessarily fundamental. If a man is dying from a kidney disease, although it's terrible, few people would say he has the right to force someone to give up their kidney, so in that case, almost everyone would agree that the right to bodily autonomy takes precedence over the right of the dying man to live. So the right to life isn't necessarily sacrosanct. But I also don't think the right to bodily autonomy is necessarily sacrosanct. We have the draft, which requires someone to get in shape, and put their life and body in harm's way, yet most people would say this is morally justifiable.

"t1_dgb0fam"	"berrieh"	"20"	"&gt; Nobody argues for forced impregnation, but it isn't in fact clear that you should be able to change the status quo once someone's life depends on you. You can't say \\"I want my kidney back!\\" after a donation, for example, even if it turns out that your consent wasn't informed.Not the same, and here's why. While bodily autonomy can be a factor in sexual autonomy (i.e. the right not to be raped, etc), bodily autonomy doesn't cease to exist because of choices in sexual autonomy. Of course, you cannot legally claim rape after the fact when you gave consent because the guy dumped you, just as you cannot legally claim you want your kidney back. You cannot take back consent. That is true. But a person doesn't consent to be pregnant generally. They consent to sex. Bodily autonomy for the kidney that has been donated does stop once the kidney has been removed. You have autonomy over your body until that point. If you are a donor and begin the initial process but change your mid before the donation is complete, you are allowed to do so (depending on circumstances, you may incur medical costs, etc, I imagine). Because the kidney is still in your body, and your right to bodily autonomy impacts your own body. Once it's in someone else, the right to bodily autonomy is theirs and that's why you can't get the kidney back. So, once a kid is born and can live outside a womb, you absolutely don't have the right to medically abort it -- that'd be the same as your kidney analogy. As long as it's not a child who can live on its own as an individual organism but is a clump of cells inside the person that *requires* a human incubator, the right to bodily autonomy applies."
"t1_dgbb4hx"	"wonderworkingwords"	"1"	"The kidney analogy is being taken to far here. The point is that abortion only makes sense in the context of an existing pregnancy. As such, the question isn't whether someone dependent on your body \\"has a right to it\\", but rather how to resolve the tension between one's right to life and one's right to bodily autonomy. That's why the kidney analogy is interesting, because it biases the scenario in the same way, but against bodily autonomy arguments, as such arguments are naturally and deliberately biased (because the \\"disconnection\\" of the violinist in that analogy is underselling the severity of such an act, and because of language like \\"just a clump of cells\\")."

Obviously, abortion only applies to pregnancy, just as a kidney donation only applies when someone needs a kidney.The question is absolutely whether something (I wouldn't say someone, personally, as a person has to have at some point existed as an autonomous being) has a right to someone else's body, though. Even more so than with the kidney, frankly, as at least with the kidney analogy, there is a confirmation of an actually alive human being who requires a new kidney vs. a clump of cells that has no personhood."

Assuming that most(or even a significant percentage of) women have inferiority complexes is rather difficult to prove and undermines much of the feminist movement, which is ironic considering that most feminists are pro-choice. Psychology is a gray field.Edit: The reason why I typed this up is because Mitoza implied that women also have inferiority complexes when he/she said this:;I don't think there are other options. Idiocy in light of evidence or clarification is either an unconscious choice, and from there we can analyze what dissonance is causing the refusal, or it is a conscious choice, in which case it is politically motivated. In either case, overt or unconscious sexism surely plays a role.It has long been a pro-choice assumption/ suppressing point that women who are pro-life have an inferiority complex. Ironically, this also undermines the feminist movement. Why should the movement elevate women socially to do what men have always done? Do they feel that men have more freedom, and thus feel inferior to men because they have that freedom, and then because of that inferiority convince society to elevate them to the level of men? Why not instead convince society that the work of women around the house is more noble than the men who go to work, rather than advocating for themselves to work?These are questions not many Westerners (especially liberals) want to answer."

You don't have to have an inferiority complex to have internalized sexist ideals/notions/traditions or even internalized misogyny (and not all internalized sexism = internalized misogyny), so your point doesn't really make much sense. Most women and men (even feminists who are pro-choice) have some internalized gender roles bullshit in their socialization. Some may be aware and overcome them, but certainly not the majority. Sexism is ingrained at the societal and social level, not the individual level, in most cases.

"t1_dgbiuls"	"Positron311"	"2"	"&gt; But men and women already have all the same rights... so what's the point of feminism?I think that the feminist movement should be remade into a social movement against misogyny. I'll explain what I mean by this.The feminist movement has been, at its roots, a movement that has advocated respecting women. Yet how many women today wear exposing clothing, whether it be at work, school, at the bar, etc.? The fact is that men want women to expose their bodies in public, and the fashion trends for women imply that they want to seek attention from men and outdo other women by exposing more skin. This gives out an implicit message that they want others to judge them only by their physical appearance. Women should start with respecting themselves and not conforming to what men want women to wear or how men want women to act. Yet most women who are feminists turn away from this in shock, and still wonder why society does not respect them. I think that liberalism denies too much of our identites, but conservatism is a little too optimistic about human nature IMO. I think there's something in the middle that would be the best for the world, but hey, what do I know?"

I wouldn't be surprised if /u/Mitoza actually did support that position.A foetus prior to the third trimester is not a human being and does not have moral interests sufficient to overcome the mother's.

Again, no one who is arguing for abortion from a philosophical position would be able to form a cohesive argument for post-viability abortions without proving fetuses do not possess personhood (and we can't do that). That is why the law and pro-choice advocates (legitimate voices in the conversation, not random people with no understanding of the underlying rationale for the law) argue for exactly the position you state.

Post-viability abortions aren't defensible from the position of bodily autonomy because after viability, removing someone from using your body is technically just giving birth. \\"Aborting\\" a pregnancy at that point is then an active choice to end a life and not \\"pulling the cord out\\" so to speak.In the violinist analogy, a pre-viability abortion would be removing whatever support system connects you and the dying violinist. You are not actively taking a life. In the same analogy, a post-viability abortion would be like cutting the violinist's throat even when he theoretically no longer needed your body to survive. I think you may have read too far into that statement. Most people will make that distinction so as to preempt any nonsense arguments about personhood; personhood is irrelevant in this ethical argument for abortion but personhood is often the most common disagreement in the public debate over abortion.EDIT: I feel it's also important to make sure we're all starting from a common place. \\"A Defense of Abortion\\" by Judith Jarvis Thompson is widely considered to be the most poignant philosophical examination of abortion. This thread has largely drawn on those themes perhaps without providing the necessary context. A quick google search of the title should get you to that essay in full.

If a foetus could be considered a human being prior to viability (I don't know enough about embryology to know, but suppose mental cognition started at 5 months), then the foetus would be a person and would have rights prior to viability.I don't have time at the moment to read that essay, but I will shortly."

After this point, the foetus starts approximating a human being more and more so each day, until it's born. A woman who is pregnant and in a liberal democracy will generally have ample opportunity to abort the pregnancy before this point. By choosing to delay her abortion until this point arrives, she allows a dependant human being to exist, where otherwise one would not.

I have explicitly argued that you can't violate the right to life without, at the same time, violating bodily autonomy, but you can violate bodily autonomy without violating the right to life."
"t1_dgchjja"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"Box A in that analogy is the right to life. Being left with box b makes it larger and encompassing. I'm not confused, you don't understand the setd"

"t1_dgcqdft"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"No"
"t1_dgcskbf"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"Can bodily autonomy exist independently without the right to life?"
"t1_dgcsuwo"	"Mitoza"	"29"	"The right to bodily autonomy implies the right to life. It's a consequence of having bodily autonomy."
"t1_dgc1n0w"	"aboy5643"	NA	"I honestly don't know how to better explain this. This is really basic formal logic..."
"t1_dgbiyw6"	"aboy5643"	NA	"This is just a basic failing of logic on your part. A (right to bodily autonomy) contains B (right to life) and C (right to not be forced to donate blood?? lmao idk kinda specific). Violations of B and C thus are violations of A but a violation of B is not necessarily a violation of C and vice versa."
"t1_dgbuhds"	"MnemonicFitness"	NA	"How is violaton of B not indirectly a violation of C in your example? By violating B, you lose C. Violation of B, leads to violation of A, which in turn leads to violation of C - the general right to bodily autonomy is violated and therefore your protection against blood donation is gone, you no longer have it. C ceases to exist, because A ceases to exist due to the subject now being dead."

"t1_dgb0if7"	"berrieh"	"20"	"But men cannot get pregnant, so that is a moot point."
"t1_dgb31az"	"moonflower"	"51"	"No, it's not moot, because it shows that being against the killing of foetuses is not inherently sexist."
"t1_dgb4ziv"	"kaijyuu"	"5"	"pro-lifers *could* be against it, but because men cannot get pregnant, we don't know. if anti-abortion sentiment is also sexist, then people are fine (or at least neutral) with only women being disenfranchised."
"t1_dgb9xp3"	"moonflower"	"51"	"Exactly - you don't know - because it is not *inherently* sexist."
"t1_dgbf6tf"	"kaijyuu"	"5"	"because women are the only ones who can become pregnant, it *is* sexist in the sense that it governs a woman's right to bodily autonomy in a manner that men are not - only when and if men can become pregnant as easily as women and they are treated in the same manner will it be proven to *not* be sexist."
"t1_dgbw658"	"moonflower"	"51"	"Which means that it is not *inherently* sexist."
"t1_dgb5om8"	"berrieh"	"20"	"It does not. It shows that biology makes this a concern irrelevant to men, but that doesn't stop it from being inherently sexist."
"t1_dgba7qe"	"moonflower"	"51"	"No, it's not *inherently* sexist - if modern medical technology enabled a man to grow or transplant a uterus and to somehow sustain a surrogate pregnancy, there might be some anti-abortionists who would be against *him* having an abortion - because they are against the killing of foetuses, *not* because they are against women doing what they want."

"t1_dgbzage"	"moonflower"	"51"	"If you understood it, you wouldn't be saying it's wrong."
"t1_dgc8gvn"	"berrieh"	"20"	"This is untrue. I can understand you without agreeing with you."
"t1_dgc900k"	"moonflower"	"51"	"If some, or probably most, anti-abortionists would also be against men having abortions, how is it inherently sexist to be against killing foetuses?"
"t1_dgca9x5"	"berrieh"	"20"	"Because the outcomes of such legislation are inherently sexist since men do not have to deal with this issue biologically. I explained this in my detailed answer to OP. As OP hasn't responded to me at all or to anyone in ages, I'm out, but you're not addressing my core points at all. Just saying random shit."

"t1_dgbj23s"	"nerak33"	"1"	"Would it be sexist to be against the right of a men to not treat ebola if he's carrying it? Because many countries with ebola made men and women treat it against their will, because hospital conditions weren't exactly human or because patients did not understand why they were being restrained. Which of course is a mess, suppose only men could get ebola so we had a situation where boily autonomy is only being denied to men in this case. Is this sexist, or just the result of this particular condition only happening to men?"
"t1_dgbjf8s"	"jakefromstatefarm10"	NA	"How about you pick an example that has even a little bit to do with reality?"
"t1_dgbjycs"	"nerak33"	"1"	"I completely get what you're saying, but this wasn't an example. It was an alegory, because what I mean is that it seems sexist hence there is nothing as huge as pregnancy that is gender-specific and happens to men. However, it doesn't necessarily mean having specific restrictions to pregnancy (like not being allowed to terminate it) is sexist. It might mean that society is restricting pregnancy for other reasons, however since only women get pregnant, only women are affected.I did, however, gave an \\"example\\" that is not gender specific but that is very real. If there is threat to other people's lives, we do not get full bodily autonomy. None of us, in any country of the world, does. The only specific condition of Africa is that 1) hospital conditions are bad and 2) people are not well informed - actually the specific, weird conditions belong to the first world, where 1) being secluded because of an epidemy actually won't be an opressive experience and 2) people will actually be willing to go to quarantine. But this is a very real subject that simply doesn't *need* to get discussed because no one will discuss if ebola-stricken people have the right to deny treatment (quarantine) or not. They simply don't, because if they could many of them would choose to go free meaning entire towns could perish because of their choice.I still call this an \\"example\\" between quotes because ebola isn't pregnancy. Nothing is exactly like a pregnancy. But there is something that is common to both of them, which what you were discussing: how far does the right to bodily autonomy goes. For a number of reason I believe the answer is \\"as far as any other right goes\\". There are many other issues regarding the right to abortion, including the status of the embryo/fetus."

"t1_dgbmk66"	"nerak33"	"1"	"I don't know sweeheart. In Brazil most women are against abortion, but the middle and upper classes are for it, so they want the Supreme Court (9 men and 2 women) to rule for it. So a court of men will legalize abortion (like they did in the US) while the majority of women are against it. Is that misoginy? I think it's just elitism, they don't think those women opinions are worth less because they're women, just because they're poor."
"t1_dgbmo1e"	"jakefromstatefarm10"	NA	"&gt;In Brazil most women are against abortionBecause they have internalized misogyny after generations under patriarchy."
"t1_dgbn2yu"	"nerak33"	"1"	"So in Brazil, when women don't get to decide but a room full of men do, it's good. When it's in the US it's bad. The difference is wheter women are going to agree with you or not. Thanks goodness we have those good educated men to tell our women what's best."
"t1_dgbn4by"	"jakefromstatefarm10"	NA	"Those women are STUPID and MISOGYNISTS. Full rights for their bodies."
"t1_dgbng8y"	"nerak33"	"1"	"Anyway, isn't this very circular?There're some definitions for stupid: like, being unable to understand or pay attention to what' going on. Not like in the human condition, but in a way than is lesser than average people do or should so, that's \\"stupid\\".Misoginy is hating women.But if those people don't agree with your opinion on abortion, they're stupid even if they know what's going on, misogynists even if they don't hate women. If I try to talk about bodily autonomy, you say \\"doesn't matter because it's misogyny\\". If I say it's not misogyny you say \\"doesn't matter because it's about their bodies\\". It goes round and round and can't actually be debated.But if it can't be debated, why even denounce that *men* in Washington are trying to decide it regardless of women's opinions, even *any* thing they say that you don't agree is misogynistic regardless; why denounce that *men* are doing it if you would think it equally misogynistic if women were doing it?"
"t1_dgbnowm"	"jakefromstatefarm10"	NA	"Anti-abortion is anti-women. I was pointing out they're MEN to emphasize."
"t1_dgbo1nz"	"nerak33"	"1"	"But if it is black and white like this, than \\"anti-women\\" doesn't literally mean that anymore. Because, as we already saw, even when \\"anti-abortion\\" does not mean any other negative attittude to women it's still \\"anti-women\\". So \\"anti women\\" doesn't mean anything anymore. It just means \\"anti-abortion\\". You can literally die to protect women from abuse and still be anti-women shit if you're anti-abortion. In this case, if \\"anti-women\\" doesn't mean anything, it doesn't mean anything bad. But it's till bad to listen, feels bad to be called, and there's a social impact on calling people this, even if it has no meaning. So it becomes name-calling.Would I be misrepresenting your views if I guesses this name-calling is acceptable if it is for the benefit of the cause of protecting choice?"
