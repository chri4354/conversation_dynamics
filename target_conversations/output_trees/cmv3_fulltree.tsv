0	t3_5shhx3	Rockmar1	7.0	"I'm making this CMV because I've noticed that my views on abortion don't really line up with either of the two main viewpoints on it (although they're much closer to a pro-choice viewpoint than a pro-life one). This isn't so much one specific view as it is a collection of related views regarding abortion.I'll specifically list the things that I believe and the things that I don't believe. I think it's good to address both sides because we live in a world where a simple sentence like \\I support gun rights\\"" has people immediately jumping to conclusions about your views on everything from race relations and gay marriage to economic standpoints and foreign policy. Addressing both sides helps to avoid people reaching incorrect conclusions.Important note: For the purposes of this discussion I am writing this with the assumption in mind that a fetus at any point in development is equivalent to a human life. I **do not** believe this and I will explain my reasons for making this assumption in the \\""Things I don't believe\\"" section.Also, I am from the U.S.A. and I will be writing this with specific regards to the United States. When I say 'government', 'society', etc. I mean the U.S. government or U.S. society.**Things that I believe***View*: Abortions help society.*Reasoning*: There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies. For starters, every human who is born takes up a lot of resources, and produces a lot of pollution. The average American is responsible for roughly 20 tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year ([source](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02/carbon-emissions-per-person-capita)). Essentially, humans are bad for the environment so less humans is a good thing if we consider climate change to be important.Additionally, unwanted babies are more likely to grow up in bad situations (since they were unwanted), and are more likely to become criminals detrimental to society, or if not criminals then people on welfare which is also detrimental to society. Now yes, it is possible that some aborted baby would have grown up to be the next Einstein. But since it is more likely that they will end up being detrimental to society, I see no reason why we should assume that the less likely of two outcomes will happen.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Women of any age, citizenship status, etc. should be able to get an abortion from any abortion clinic for free, no questions asked.*Reasoning*: In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 ([source](https://clearhealthcosts.com/blog/2014/06/much-abortion-cost-draft-theresas/)). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).*Reasoning*: More (accurate) information is never a bad thing. Requiring doctors to inform patients about both options will allow the pregnant woman to make a more informed decision on whether or not to abort. If you oppose a doctor simply informing their patient of the facts, then you oppose spreading knowledge and have no place in any sort of philosophical discussion. If you still do not like the fact that the woman may be more likely to choose abortion when they are more aware of the facts, then maybe you should rethink your position on the matter because when people gain knowledge on the subject they become more likely to disagree with you.--------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.*Reasoning*: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.Also not that this is fundamentally different from things such as breastfeeding or a mother simply providing food for her child. Breast milk serves no purpose to the mother, and the nutrients stored in food do not belong to anyone until they consume that food. In this way, a fetus in the womb truly does steal nutrients from the mother. A baby does not steal nutrients from the mother, but rather uses nutrients that were either useless to the mother (breastmilk), or provided by the mother as a gift and therefore never the mother's in the first place.----------------------------------------------------------------------------*View*: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.*Reasoning*: This point will probably cause the most controversy. Many people will disagree with this because late in the pregnancy, the fetus would be able to survive on its own if it were surgically removed from the woman in the proper manner. However, I believe that just because it would be able to survive on its own does not change the fact that it is still essentially a parasite and the woman still deserves the right to remove that parasite from her body. The fetus, while in the womb, is still feeding off the nutrients of the mother (regardless of whether or not it could survive outside the womb), and therere should be treated as a parasite.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------**Things that I do not believe***View*: Women should be forced to have abortions.*Reasoning*: This one is obvious but it must be stated, I do not believe that any woman, for any reason, should EVER be forced into having an abortion. Encouraging them is fine, informing them is fine, forcing them is not.--------------------------------------*View*: A fetus's life is equivalent to a human life*Reasoning*: As I mentioned earlier, I want this discussion to be had with the assumption in mind that fetus's are equivalent to human lives. However, I do not believe this is true. The reason I wish for this to be the assumption is that pro-lifers tend to get hung up on this which I know will lead to a meaningless discussion because I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were **uneqivocally proven** that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to \\""I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way.\\""----------------------------------*View*: All killing is bad*Reasoning*: There are many forms of killing that are generally considered acceptable. Soldiers kill other soldiers in wartime, people are allowed to kill in self-defense, and criminals are executed due to their crimes. All of these are perfectly legal forms of killing, and though some are controversial most would agree that at least one of the three is justified. I believe that abortion is another one of these types of killing. This is also why I don't care whether the fetus is a human or not - I view it as a legally and morally justified form of killing.While I am interested in having my view changed, I am also interested in simply having a discussion on the topic.

15	t1_ddfcllh	BrotherNuclearOption	1.0	Granted, the gap is somewhat closer but the abortion debate is far from over, especially in the USA. Pro-life and -choice both sit just [a little under 50% according to Gallup](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1576/abortion.aspx). You also have a very strong moral minority pushing to defund organizations providing abortions (no matter what else they happen to do) and generally reduce access wherever possible. And then there are the vacant and soon to be vacant Supreme Court seats, which could have a pretty major influence on whether it remains legal.I think there is a limit to how rapidly you can force change down society's throat. I don't know when the right time would be other than it probably isn't while nearly half the population still opposes the very idea of normalized abortion.	0.33906444907188416	0.4975014626979828	0.43602803349494934
16	t1_ddfnmef	SueZbell	1.0	We should certainly support more birth control and make abortion easier. Arguably, nothing affects a woman's mental health more than issues involving reproduction.

China, after many years with its one child policy, requiring subsequent pregnancies to be prevented or aborted, has recently determined that millions of pregnancies -- mostly female births -- went unreported. Reproduction is one of life's stronger instincts, including in humans. A far better policy would be to teach children the truth about sex and reproduction and over population and problems associated with adding certain traits -- mental and physical defects -- to the gene pool and try to guide future generations toward a more practical choice -- each person be a parent to no more than two children, with the objective of each couple only reproducing themselves between their own life/death -- and not increasing the population beyond that.	0.5042102336883545	0.4992509186267853	0.4868625998497009

35	t1_ddfu435	cyrusol	2.0	I don't actually want to argue against your view about abortion itself since I do not have an opinion myself.But I do think your argumentation is extremely flawed.__Objection:__ Ever since the early stages of the stone age a human on average _produced_ more than he _consumed_.I completely disregard what each human produces or consumes at this point. Division of labor is efficient, i.e. the Earth could not sustain that many people if each human was to produce exactly that amount of oxygen and food and clean water that he consumes. Division of labor results in some humans produce no plants (no oxygen), no food and no water at all while some produce more. Nothing ground-breaking.I also disregard the fact that currently some environmental resources currently may be used up more than they are regained, i.e. that our agrarian industry, our water usage etc. are not really sustainable.However, the core aspect of this objection holds true. The fact that a steadily lower part of humanity has to work for acquiring food and water is proof of it. Automation is not something that just happens on the own, it is the accumulated excess of labor put into use. There couldn't ever have been automation if a human would consume more than he produces as he would have been required to put 100% of his time into actually acquiring resources to survive (food, water, air) to just barely survive. He wouldn't have had time to invent machines to make his life easier. Likewise, the still increasing amount of automation is a strong indicator that a human still produces more than he consumes.I would probably accept your argument if the world was in a shape so bad that it couldn't sustain additional life anymore, i.e. if additional humans would not have the possibility to produce more than to consume.But currently you saying unwanted babies would be detrimental to the environment is absolutely dishonest. They are more likely to benefit the society, and as soon as the environment is a resource that is scarce enough for more people to care about, they are also more likely to benefit the environment.	0.011318720877170563	0.3444301187992096	0.3926062285900116

Almost all of your views are pretty similar to most pro-choice activists that I have encountered.I guess the only point that pro-choice people wouldn't really agree with is that doctors should be required to tell all pregnant patients the details of an abortion. I'm all for the spread of knowledge, but honestly, if a woman comes in and is jumping for joy at being pregnant, telling her about abortion is just going to waste the doctor's time. She'll just tune him out, maybe get offended, and it's obvious it's a wanted pregnancy. Now if a woman comes in and is more unsure about their pregnancy, then of course abortion info should be provided.	0.35927996039390564	0.47572755813598633	0.3813270032405853

Who are they to decide what a woman does with her body, right?All of this changed when i spend 2 hours one evening with a former abortion doctor. He had performed over 20k abortions throughout his career. It made him a very wealthy man, so walking away from the business was not only politically polarizing, it was detrimental to his families wealth.I sat and listened to him explain with detail, what happens during an abortion. My stomach turned, and at one point i thought i was going to vomit. He detailed the instruments he used for the abortion. The vice grips: Where he would begin to rip the child apart limb from limb inside the womb. He would rip an arm off, then a leg. Then he would use the vice grips to crush the childs skull. He knew it was a good grip when he could see the yellow ooze on the instrument, which was the childs brains.

43	t1_ddghkny	Rockmar1	7.0	&gt; I know that the majority of americans are clueless as to what happens in an abortion procedure.The majority of Americans know what they need to know about abortion procedures - it removes the fetus from the woman and the fetus is killed in the process. You don't really need the details beyond that.I get what you're saying, it's not exactly a pleasant procedure. But there's no such thing as a pleasant surgery. Watch a video of a heart transplant, or a kidney removal. I'm sure that those would be pretty gruesome too. So should we start making people who need a kidney removed watch a video of the surgery?You can definitely think of it as murder if that's what it seems like to you. The only way to change your mind on that would be to convince you that the fetus is not equal to a human life. I don't think I can do that because right now we just don't have the science to pinpoint exactly where a human life begins. Most people don't think that an egg transforms into a human the microsecond that sperm touches it. Maybe you do, but that's a pretty hard position to defend. And everyone agrees that a born baby is a human. So somewhere between those two things it must go from a bundle of cells to a human. But where exactly is that point? That's what's controversial.So the best I can say is that yes, maybe it is murder. But I don't care. It's murder that makes everyone's life better. It's murder that saves a child from growing up in a shit situation. It's murder that alleviates a potential burden from society, and especially from the mother and father. It's murder that could save that woman's life, and does she not deserve a fair shot at her life too? That's why I don't really care if you think it's murder. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But it certainly isn't the exact same thing as just walking up to someone on the street and blowing their head off with a shotgun. If you can't see the difference there, then there's not a whole lot of discussion left to be had. But there's a crystal clear difference there to me, and that's why I support abortion rights.	0.7119739651679993	0.5284116864204407	0.4326278567314148

47	t1_ddffpvr	cookiebootz		I've addressed the points I disagree with. ;**View: Abortions help society.**I argue that only truly elective abortions help society. Compulsory abortions and coerced abortions do not help society, they create a society where a woman’s reproductive choices are still subject to public scrutiny and social pressure, just in a different way than they are now. Just as I think people are harmed by women being pressured to keep a pregnancy they don’t want, I think people are harmed by women being pressured (or “encouraged”) to abort a pregnancy they wanted, but were made to feel like they didn't deserve to have for whatever reason. I agree that more information is never a bad thing, but I wouldn’t say abortions should be encouraged. I don’t think this is a choice that should be encouraged either by anyone else except the woman first and foremost, her partner, and anyone else they decide to ask for input. ;**View: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.**The purpose of abortion is not to kill a fetus, it’s to alleviate the woman of the burden of pregnancy. If, a week before her due date, a woman decided she no longer wanted to be pregnant, the baby could be delivered alive and relatively healthy that same day. An abortion is then excessive, when elective delivery can preserve the interests of both the woman and the baby.I recognize there’s a pretty big window of time where the fetus is technically viable but would suffer potentially significant health issues if delivered. I don’t really know what to say about this except that I think medical technology will continue to shrink this window. But I don’t think it’s necessary to refuting this point to know what I think should be done in these situations.	0.06482373923063278	0.3590070903301239	0.43212074041366577

51	t1_ddfn1id	SueZbell	1.0	"To say you're pro abortion implies you always support abortion as opposed to carrying a fetus to term and giving birth. Unless you actually mean you support zero births, it is far more likely that you are pro choice but do wish more people would choose abortion.I would disagree with a 100% abortion decision -- without \\choice\\"" resulting in &lt; zero population growth as it would eventually end humanity. I wouldn't disagree with a \\""pro-choice\\"" view, even if that view included the belief that abortion should be chosen more, which, I suspect, is more likely your intent -- unless you want an end to humanity or are supporting cloning in lieu of birth or some other way to replace some of the humans that die that I haven't thought of yet. There are good reasons to keep the \\""choice\\"" legal:Children should be wanted by both parents; if that is not the case, abortion should at least be considered as an option. Unwanted, neglected children are less likely to grow up to be happy, healthy well-adjusted adults and, therefore, are not helpful to achieving and may well even be detrimental to creating and maintaining a happy and healthy society.With the global population approaching 8 billion, it would make sense that each person only reproduce themselves -- each person reproducing only themselves and one mate: no man would be a biological father to more than two children and no woman would give birth to more than two children ... IF the population of earth is going to stop growing before it increases to a point not sustainable with earth's resources -- a worthwhile objective.Bringing mentally or physically handicapped people into the gene pool is, arguably, not beneficial to the future health of humanity.Forcing a victim of rape or incest to bear a child is nothing less than a second rape or attack of the victim by society. Deciding that the mental and physical life of a woman is less valuable than the nascent life of a fetus is, in my view, wrong.Religion is often the reason most anti-choice people object to abortion but that is simply not a good reason to discount abortion of a pregnancy as an option.Freedom from tyranny requires the right to have an abortion be protected. Religion, every flavor of it, is a man made power tool fueled by fear and need and greed. Religion has created to satisfy a lust by some for power over others and how others live their lives -- whether influence or outright control -- whether for good or ill.While I agree that freedom requires freedom OF religion, freedom of religion must include freedom FROM religion. Freedom FOR religion and no right to be free from religion is nothing less than tyranny.Some lives actually are more valuable than others. Arguably, the life of an actual person already born could be deemed more valuable than potential life -- certainly to that living person.Life certainly is not \\""sacred\\"": absent hypocrisy, the religious folk that claim all life is \\""sacred\\"" would reject all killing, including the death penalty and bombs that destroy all life within hundreds of yards of where they hit, including innocent life. An America that actually did, \\""In God We Trust\\"", would, therefore, not have a military with which to defend it, much less arguably the most powerful military in the history of humanity.Even though one might argue that all life has value, it's not equal value: compare the life of a young healthy medical medical professional that is an upstanding member of the community, well liked and trusted and respected, in contrast to the the life of an unemployed and unemployable drug addict or drunk or with a murderous pedophile or a sadistic rapist; then consider to which person you'd be more willing to risk your own life to throw a lifeline."""	0.9993484020233154	0.8073424696922302	0.37828534841537476
52	t1_ddfgrki	AmoebaMan	7.0	&gt;View: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.;Reasoning: A fetus is similar to parasite for several reasons. During pregnancy, the fetus feeds off the nutrients of the mother, while providing virtually no health benefits in return. Additionally, pregnancy can result in complications that lead to the death or disability of the mother. This is analogous to a parasite such a a mosquito which feeds off another being's nutrients, provides no benefit to the host, and can result in serious harm to the host. If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.A newborn infant satisfies most of the important criteria of parasitism that you've described here (health complications for the host are *not* an integral part of parasitism; many parasites have a vested interest in their host remaining healthy for as long as possible). They are sustained entirely through the effort of the mother (or father), and offer no benefits in return (aside from things like mood buffs, which can pregnancy also offer).Given your later view that...;View: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.I'd like to know what exactly you think is the line in the sand? If killing a fetus (an infant inside the womb) is justifiable but killing an newborn (an infant outside the womb) is not, what is the difference? What makes one okay but the other not?You seem to rely heavily on the parasitism argument, but as I already noted, it's hard to argue that a newborn is any less of a parasite than a fetus. It may not draw its sustenance directly from the body of its host, but it very much draws it from their energy and efforts.	0.9942091703414917	0.7215979695320129	0.41773051023483276

59	t1_ddfs31u	barejoke		Hi, firstly let me say that I really appreciate how you've broken down the contents of your beliefs within a very controversial area into a structured and composed stance. I'd also like to state that I am actually in agreement with you in the majority of your views so will not attempt to de-construct your position overall.The only one I am a little on the fence about is the choice to abort right up until birth. Generally, I agree that during most of the pregnancy, a fetus can be considered as a parasite as it is physically damaging to the host without any benefits. The only exception to this, in my opinion, is where the fetus is wanted in which case there are emotional benefits bestowed upon the host as well as a long term investment benefit of raising a child. However, your argument does revolve around unwanted children so we can park this argument. The other instance where I would not consider them as a parasite is where they have reached the developmental stage that allows them to survive outside of the womb, which you have actually acknowledged. While I don't necessarily disagree that they go from leeching off one source of nutrients (the mother) to leeching off another source of nutrients (free hospital care), I think the distinction here is that it becomes a different kind of parasite, a transferable one if you will. Now the only reason I think you should not be able to abort in this instance is that if it can survive outside of the womb, it can be considered a life and, thus, abortion can be considered as killing. I'm still not entirely against the idea of aborting the transferable parasite as it is still considered as a drain on resources with no payback but my issue is, where do you draw the line?A fetus at that stage can still contribute to society in the long run once it has reached adulthood despite requiring significant national investment. However, someone that is retired with no savings is dependent on leeching 'nutrients' from society and has very little chance of ever repaying that investment. Perhaps they can repay in an indirect form such as emotional relationships to their current associations. Perhaps keeping those individuals alive is seen as a repayment for their working life where they have contributed to society for over 40 years. Perhaps it would be seen as a deterrent to contributing to society as a whole if all society will do is terminate you when you are no longer useful. In which case, would it be justifiable to terminate someone who has reached retirement age after years of collecting welfare with no positive emotional connections left in the world? That approach can definitely be seen as a deterrent to those who are not motivated to contribute to society when they can. How about those who are disabled to the point where they will never be able to contribute to society. They could perhaps be seen as a perpetual transferable parasite, is it justified to terminate them? Finally, wouldn't this argument lend itself to justify the capital punishment for life-term prisoners?I'm not sure I entirely disagree with you on this thread of your argument, it's just the one that I am least certain about. From a purely logical point of view, I could consider the termination of all the above rationally sound, justifiable and even desirable. However, looking at it from a top-level doesn't sit right with me. Should we euthanise old people who are no longer are of use and never have been of use? Should we execute those who have committed a crime and in turn, we may be committing quite possibly that same crime ourselves against them? Should we terminate those who suffer from such serious ailments that they could never meaningfully contribute economically to our society and increase the cruelty which has already been bestowed on to their lives? Should we allow for the abortion of a fetus where they can live and no longer cause damage to their mother just because it will cost money to do so? I guess a distinction that can be made here is that these parasites are already transferable whereas a fetus, even in that stage of its development, is still firmly within the womb and would require an invasive operation in order for it to become a transferable parasite. However, it would still require an invasive operation in order to abort a fetus at that stage. Surely if we are talking about allowing a woman to be rid of her parasite that far into her pregnancy, it should be to remove it the fetus still 'alive' rather than to kill it?Hopefully I'm not too late to this thread as abortion is rarely a topic that can be discussed openly and logically so would love to hear your thoughts.	0.6840304732322693	0.5145907402038574	0.4506152272224426

65	t1_ddg6l48	9726121530		I would like to address this point.View: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.Why should the cutoff point be birth? I would contend that post birth abortion/infanticide/whatever term you wish to use, should be acceptable for the same reasons why a late term abortion should be acceptable. For example I think it is just as justified to end the life of a newborn with a terrible birth defect as it would be to abort the fetus (abortion would be preferable, but lets take an example of something that isn't detected). The general case also goes along with your argument of reducing human impact on the planet, and reduction in social ills. Note, I do not necessarily know the cutoff point, but I do not consider a newborn fundamentally different from a late stage fetus in this regard. And I also do not think this is ideal. The earlier the abortion, the better.	0.8777751326560974	0.6286077499389648	0.42393162846565247
66	t1_ddgj03j	Rockmar1	7.0	&gt; Why should the cutoff point be birth?Because adoption is an option after birth but not before. A c-section is another option but it is less safe than an abortion (as far as my understanding goes). We should not force women who don't want their babies to go through a more dangerous surgery just to save the fetus.I also think it simply works well as a very clear cutoff point. We have to draw the line somewhere. The only two places to draw it that aren't completely arbitrary are at the moment of conception or at birth. Drawing it at the moment of conception is harmful for all kinds of reasons, so I think that birth is the best one.	0.002661533886566758	0.23424504697322845	0.36693525314331055

(*Having typed this out, my comment is a little more long winded than intended. The following paragraph and the closing paragraph make my point; the rest of the body is just supporting anecdotes, really*)There are countless of instances in which it's not only entirely unnecessary to inform the mother of the possibility of abortion, but straight up damaging as well. For one example, let's assume we're dealing with a woman who actually wants to have a baby. Presenting them with the information regarding an abortion not only useless, but offensive. It's not hard to imagine that information on abortion isn't going to be well-received by an expecting mother. Particular circumstances surrounding their pregnancy may make it worse, still. Suppose the woman has been trying to get pregnant for years and it finally happened for her. Informing her of the possibility of abortion is a smack in the face. It's easy to imagine the woman wanting a different doctor after that. You can tweak that example in many different ways to end up with a situation where the mentioning of abortion is useless at best, but more often than not detrimental.

Keep in mind that my definition may differ slightly from yours as to what \\""standard pro-choice\\"" is, but I'll try to focus on what I most commonly see.1. Standard pro-choice is generally focused on the ability for the woman to make a choice for herself (hence the name). Sorta like \\""people should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies -&gt; women are people -&gt; women should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies\\"". My view is more focused on the (almost universal) positive aspects of abortion.

Women's rights don't really factor into my view, but are a happy side effect.2. Most pro-choice people are uncomfortable with the idea of late-term abortions. I have no problem with late-term abortions, and in fact I think they should be encouraged (if it comes to it, early term abortions are better, but late term is still better than childbirth).3. As far as I know, \\""standard pro-choice\\"" does not support government funded abortions or mandatory doctor information about abortions. Essentially, I think that abortions should be incentived by the government as opposed to childbirth. Standard pro choice usually views abortions as a \\""necessary evil\\""; something that should NOT be encouraged but should still be an option.4. Terminology. I haven't mentioned this one yet because it's quite different from the others, but I simply think that the term \\""pro-choice\\"" is stupid. You can be pro-gun without thinking that gun ownership should be mandatory. You can be pro-marijuana without thinking that everyone should be required to smoke weed.

Abortion is an extremely common topic on CMV but yours actually seems to bring something novel to the table.I'd like to focus my comment on one of your views.;View: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).I'm a practicing physician and pro-choice. I have 2 comments about this subview. The first is from a personal morality standpoint and the other from a practical standpoint.1. If a physician is morally opposed to abortion then they should not be forced by the government to engage in activities they find morally objectionable. I have been directly asked by patients for specific diagnostic testing and therapies that oppose my own ethics and morals. All physicians should be free to follow their personal ethics.2. Let's say number 1 didn't convince you. Then we have a practical/implementation problem. If you do force a doctor to counsel on the opportunity of abortion - the information will come with significant spin that will reflect the doctors bias. When making medical decisions, how the information is presented is as important as the information itself. I'm not saying that a pregnant women should not be informed of their options, only that having the doctor do it would be suboptimal; each doctor would spin the information to reflect their own personal bias.

163	t1_ddfivt8	peeup		I don't think that you're really pro-abortion, or at least you shouldn't be. Here's why:I agree with you on all the points you made, and you claim (if I understand correctly) that the big difference between your view and pro-choice is that you believe that abortion is the correct option rather than just an option. For me, and I think for you too, the morality of abortions doesn't really concern the fetus because it has no agency, it isn't human, it's a parasite, etc. However, you should consider the massive psychological problems with abortion. I am not a woman, but I know a few who have had abortions and they tell me that, even years later, the operation still weighs on them heavily. Nightmares of their baby's eyes and voices. Constant guilt - survivor's guilt even. Having an abortion is unlike any other medical operation; even if you are not taking away life, you do have to live with pulling the plug on potential life. That can really mess with you. This must be weighed properly against the pragmatics of abortion.Certainly you are not pro-psychological damage. And, unfortunately, that is a necessary consequence of abortion. Therefore, I don't think its right for you or most anyone to label themselves as pro-abortion as you have defined it. Pro-choice is a label, but it is also a spectrum. You can be pro-choice and also believe that abortions are the best option, much in the same way that you can be a Republican and still want to fund something like social security.	0.48892709612846375	0.513862669467926	0.4572061598300934

179	t1_ddfnbvr	wizardnamehere		A fetus's life has moral value. Because people's lives have moral value.We could discuss in nuance the moral value of a fetus's life and what i mean but i'll skip. What also has to be worked out is the legal rights and status of a fetus; that is when in between a zygote and a fully functioning adult legal rights are gained.There are other moral values involved, like the ability to pursue a life in a certain way, autonomy over your body. The existence of these moral values do not cancel out the existence of any of these others.An abortion can have a positive affect on people's lives affecting things like personal autonomy and the ability to pursue a certain kind of life. Yet as above, this doesn't cancel out the moral value that a fetus has.The statement that either ALL abortions are a good thing, or that no abortion ever is a good thing is not very sophisticated. Either position taken up ignores the moral value of something, whether it's the moral value of a fetus's right to live or the moral value of a woman's autonomy and right to pursue a life.Thus you should moderate your position and consider all of the factors involved that you can.	0.9740611910820007	0.5887424945831299	0.4490925669670105

183	t1_ddfq756	keystorm	1.0	"&gt; In order for this to be free, I suggest a small federal tax increase to cover the cost of government funded abortions. The tax would only need to be minimal - the average cost of an abortion is a little less than $500 (source[2] ). This is a relatively tiny amount of money to the government, so the tax increase would be minimal.The benefits however, would be huge. It is highly likely that easier abortion access would help reduce the global carbon footprint, and would also reduce crime. This isn't even going into the fact that it would help improve the lives of the potential mother and father in a very direct way if the pregnancy was unwanted. Overall, this would be a good investment for society. In addition, I mention age and citizenship status because regardless of these factors, American citizens still benefit when women get abortions.Disclaimer, I'm pro-abortion, but have grown to discover theres is an underlying implication nobody talks about (because it's a bit embarassing to use unborn life as an economic principle). Also I will grossly simplify the approach, because, well, politics.As a general rule, the right tries to slim the government. One of the implications is tax cuts, because it shouldn't need that much money, where private investment is perfectly capable to do stuff at a fair price when in competition.As a general rule, the left tries to enlarge the government. One of the implications is tax raises, because it will need more money, as private investment is not capable to keep fair prices for personal necessities.The right, which is usually anti-abortion (or pro-life as they'd put it out) has come to understand that certain state investment is needed to sustain a nation. And there is no way out from taxing people. Since direct taxes need to be avoided, they need to be more creative in how they leech money from people.One serious problem is population. More money is wasted on the older 50%, and people live longer now (or are helped to live longer, whatever your approach). So there is an actual need of young tax payers who can leverage this situation. This seems stupid and far fetched, but I assure you it is not. It is engrained in religion, and in politics. But the reasoning is always the same: we need kids so we can pay all those retirements, ensure future prosperity.You can argue the abortion numbers are fairly low in a macroeconomic scope. But if you look closer, numbers are hugely engrossed by the right winged propaganda. Would those numbers make a dent in economy? Absolutely yes, because more kids means more pregnancies, meaning more kids, meaning a \healthier\\ population pyramid. A right winged politician has wet dreams with baby booms, they are great for economy in the mid term. And what when they grow old? Well that's somebody else's problem, I'll be dead by then.\Today baby boomers are old. We desperately need new kids. Burn down those abortion clinics.

You lose me there... but I won't dwell on that, you thought of a creative new way to start the conversation. :) well played.----------------I get a little confused at your comparison of killing the fetus to killing an enemy combatant or otherwise. If you believe a fetus is a parasite and not valued as a human life than you likely would not categorize it with these forms forms of legal taking of human life in self defense, execution as punishment, or even forms of euthanasia, right? I don;t want to put words in your mouth... but you have already explained how valuing human life is different than that of an animal or parasite so to make the comparison later seems odd. You should compare abortion more to stepping on a bug or pulling off a leech and throwing it into the garbage. Even putting my dog down might have more moral hardship than removing a parasite or mosquito, so keep the line at human v. not human for simplicity. -----------------------------But to the rest of your post... I am fairly sure that the core of pretty much every view you explain here is still 100% that you believe that a fetus (at all points from conception to live birth) is not valued as a human life by you and in fact better classified as a parasite, like a mosquito. I don't get how you are asking people to look past that, or to not get \\hung up\\"" on that fact. That ABSOLUTELY IS the conversation we are having when discussing abortion in general, and we cannot sneak past the difference in belief.

I also personally think your parasite till birth view has some room for argument. Does the birth have to be natural or can it be cut out (c-section or other early procedures for troubled fetuses) to make it a human life? What if the fetus is born naturally or otherwise and then requires life support to remain alive due to complications? At what point in life do you suppose that a parasite/fetus/baby/child DOES start producing health benefits for the mother while depending on their food and other supporting functions and energy for survival? If someone walks up and stabs a woman in the stomach to end the life of her fetus but she lives, how do you judge that situation? If these are going to be your hard lines you should consider that a two year old will die if left completely alone or without parental type support and feeding 100% of the time. -------------------------Then you seem to claim (as your closing point, maybe coincidentally) that your view does not depend on that you think a fetus is not a human life, and a women should be able to kill it either way (I assume not just specifically if the mother's life is physically threatened by the fetus' living). I find that extremely hard to believe, given how you set up your parasite beliefs. Care to elaborate on how that might work? If you did think the fetus to be a human life (I am not sure how you can honestly sympathize with that), are you suggesting that killing a human life at 5 months living in the womb would be different than killing it at 5 months living in someone living room? Would you kill a 6-month-old child if the husband leaves and supporting the child now doesn't make financial sense, like you might for a child in the womb for 7 months? Is finding out at 1 and a half years old the the kid has downs syndrome the same a finding out at 6 months and a sound reason to terminate? Would you think it any more or less dependent on the parent for survival? Any more or less defenseless? Any more or less a risk to the mother or others (like in wartime or legally acceptable self-defense situations)? Any more or less deserving of human rights or protections as a human? I tend to think, that both morally and legally, if a fetus is considered a human life, and valued as a human life, then it would or should be protected as such, no?--------------------------------If you have read this far I may as well ask another question. lol. What are your thoughts when someone says that if population control and unwanted babies is the real issue here, what about not having sex to create more babies at all? And this is coming from a dude who loves sex so don't be afraid to bash the idea, haha. I only mean to say that honestly there is a MUCH easier solution to having all these unwanted babies or controlling population growth than deciding on when it is or isn't OK to kill them as a human life or not, and it would be to not create them in the first place, right? Food for thought...I honestly believe that the legality and practices of abortion or the regulations that surround it should be decided completely by women who have been consciously pregnant, otherwise your vote on the matter doesn't count, LOL! (I am not a women nor have I had kids yet FYI). Just a thought I have had as it is a hugely complicated topic. ----------------------I wish you the best though, there is a lot of good comments here. I really do enjoy conversations like this. I hope you learned something or achieved whatever it is you set out to achieve. :) Feel free to fire back!"""	0.9610428214073181	0.6558972597122192	0.43488895893096924
187	t1_ddgiql6	Rockmar1	7.0	"&gt; I am fairly sure that the core of pretty much every view you explain here is still 100% that you believe that a fetus (at all points from conception to live birth) is not valued as a human life by you and in fact better classified as a parasite, like a mosquito. I don't get how you are asking people to look past that, or to not get \\hung up\\"" on that fact. That ABSOLUTELY IS the conversation we are having when discussing abortion in general, and we cannot sneak past the difference in belief.I think you've misunderstood me here. I wasn't saying it isn't an important discussion point. I said not to get hung up on it because I wanted to avoid arguing about whether a fetus is a human or not. I don't care if it is. I don't care if it isn't. It would make no difference on my views. So since I don't care if it is a human life, I said \\""let's just assume that it IS a human life\\"" to appease the pro-lifers who would get hung up on that. I wanted the discussion to be about \\""Assuming that a fetus is a human life, is abortion still an OK thing?\\"" And my answer to that question is yes.; If you did think the fetus to be a human life (I am not sure how you can honestly sympathize with that), are you suggesting that killing a human life at 5 months living in the womb would be different than killing it at 5 months living in someone living room?That's exactly what I'm suggesting.; Would you kill a 6-month-old child if the husband leaves and supporting the child now doesn't make financial sense, like you might for a child in the womb for 7 months?No I would not because at that point adoption is an option. Adoption is not an option for a fetus. I actually awarded a delta to someone who played with the idea of some hypothetical surgical way of doing a sort of fetus adoption because it partially changed my view (regarding my terminology), but with current technology I still fully support all of the ideas I wrote.; I tend to think, that both morally and legally, if a fetus is considered a human life, and valued as a human life, then it would or should be protected as such, no?This was more what I mean when I mentioned soldiers and criminals. My point was not that a fetus is equivalent to these things. My only point was that there are already several situations where we expressly *don't* protect human life.; What are your thoughts when someone says that if population control and unwanted babies is the real issue here, what about not having sex to create more babies at all?I mean ideally that's a great idea. Good luck convincing the human race to stop having sex. People have been trying to do that for years and have gotten nowhere really. I don't think that that's a viable solution.Compare it to driving a car. If you want fewer people to die in car crashes, the solution is not to try to convince people to drive safer. The better solution is to engineer a safer car. Human error exists just like human instinct exists. You can't get rid of it. So solutions need to come from places that we DO have control of. For example, making safer cars, or allowing abortions."""	0.7343480587005615	0.5260975956916809	0.4695644974708557
188	t1_ddgr6m5	SLUnatic85		We definitely disagree on that you can take the value of the human life out of the equation. If a person thinks that life starts at conception, or at heartbeat, or at brain activity, then a fetus, a 2-year-old, a 27-year-old, and a 103-year-old are all living human beings. In most known societies there has been some moral, and often legal, system in place to protect human life (setting aside racial or other discriminatory feelings of a time). One may say it's OK to kill this bad person to protect the population, or oneself. One might say it's OK to kill a person to punish for an equal or greater crime. One might say that ending your own life is OK if you make that decision. It gets even grayer when you bring in protecting quality of life or torture... These are situations, though, in which you are weighing human lives in an equation. In almost all cases it is not on the same level of killing a dog or mosquito or tree or other non-human life. In fact generally the driving idea is to protect the right to human life. Perhaps I am off base, but that is absolutely what most people who are against abortion and even some that are for instances of abortion are considering. The value of human life.I think that I am understanding that you believe at the point of birth, coming out of the womb or cutting the umbilical cord or at some other point you hesitate to define, the value of the life becomes different. Either because it becomes a living human life, or maybe that we can see and hear it, or some other reason. You would take the life of a fetus at 8 months in the womb because the woman decides it would make her life shittier, but you would not approve if she killed the baby at three months old in it's crib for the same reason. Something has changed for you, I am just unclear as to what. For the record, if you get pregnant and don't want the child, you can absolutely put the child (or child-to-be I guess) up for adoption. Yes, it is a process like any adoption, not always fun or convenient and of course you will have to wait for the child to come out in order to give it away You might even risk developing some attachment, but you can do it. I am not sure what you were talking about, or how it relates to whether or not it is OK to kill a person. Are you saying that if giving a person away instantaneously to eliminate a problem or the potential for future problems is not an option, then it is morally OK to kill the person? That is an extremely selfish line of thinking but hopefully I am misinterpretting.Your murder/war/punishment argument really is not relevant when your opinion of whether or not it is OK to take the life changes at time of birth and is not dependent of protecting a life or the consequence of the taking of that life. It might be more relvant to say you are allowed to kill a person post-birth, only if to protect others or to punish them, but pre-birth other reasons can apply.I know that sex is not something we can stop. That is an over the top question I have wondered on that makes me wonder, and I personally struggle with the depth. But IF a person truly does believe that having an abortion is killing a person, taking the life of your child (I really think you are not relating to that concept) then it's pretty friggin' crazy to think that one would kill that child in order to avoid having to raise them, if they could have just not had sex or used a condom to likely prevent the issue. I know there are a million other factors here, it's a conversation starter. I was just curious.You talk about cars... I think it's a lousy comparion and far from apples to apples, but sure. I'll bite. And guess what? There are laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe driving to keep people from dying. If what you are saying is true, then why are people getting punished all over the world for driving unsafely? We cannot eliminate human error but we enforce laws specifically to create environments that protect human life. That's, like, the point of most laws. We have laws that protect human life in and around moving vehicles, so why not for being unborn or not able to be adopted for a few more months? I am not saying that I want abortion to be illegal with this comment, I am just also comparing it to the same car thought you laid out for me.	0.11903784424066544	0.41091468930244446	0.456632137298584

It's when the child is born. 10 seconds before birth it is not equivalent to a human, 10 seconds after birth it is. I have to draw a line in the sand somewhere, that is where I draw it.; Something has changed for you, I am just unclear as to what. The thing that has changed is that the baby switches from feeding off the mother directly to feeding off other sources. Those sources do not have to come from the biological mother after birth. Before birth, they do.; you will have to wait for the child to come out in order to give it awayAnd this carries a risk to the mother's life. She should not be forced to take that risk for something she doesn't want anyway. Especially when it helps the rest of society out too.; Are you saying that if giving a person away instantaneously to eliminate a problem or the potential for future problems is not an option, then it is morally OK to kill the person?Honestly I don't think it's morally OK for society to attach that person to you in the first place. You call it \\giving a person away\\"", but that wouldn't fly for any other person. I couldn't just show up to your home and start eating your food and say \\""I live here now\\"". There are systems in place to remove me from your life if I tried to do that. Just like there are systems in place to remove the born child from your life (adoption).But if those systems went away, what would you do? If cops weren't a thing and I just barged into your house and simply wouldn't leave, then I think you'd be justified in killing me. So yeah, it might sound harsh but if adoption weren't a thing then yes, I think that there are situations where it would be morally OK for the mother to kill the baby. Animals do it all the time, and for good reasons. If the mother had to choose between her own life, or the life of her child, I wouldn't blame her for choosing herself. I hope this not only answers your question, but also explains why I don't see that as selfish.; It might be more relvant to say you are allowed to kill a person post-birth, only if to protect others or to punish them, but pre-birth other reasons can apply.That's actually exactly what I was getting at. My point was that we tend to agree that there are exceptional circumstances in which killing can be justified.; But IF a person truly does believe that having an abortion is killing a person, taking the life of your child (I really think you are not relating to that concept) then it's pretty friggin' crazy to think that one would kill that child in order to avoid having to raise them, if they could have just not had sex or used a condom to likely prevent the issue.And if a person really truly feels that way, then it should be on them to remain celibate. I'm not advocating for forced abortions. If a woman doesn't want a baby but becomes pregnant anyway, she should have the option. But if she thinks that's murdering a baby, she can opt to not have that abortion. No one's going to force her.; There are laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe driving to keep people from dying.And in my opinion there should be laws in place in every developed nation to promote safe sex and to keep people from having unwanted pregnancies. Sex education is a thing that I fully support and think should be expanded. Just like driver's education. But we both know that even if we had 10 years of those classes, accidents will still happen.; If what you are saying is true, then why are people getting punished all over the world for driving unsafely?People don't/shouldn't get punished for driving unsafely if it truly was an unavoidable accident. Just like people shouldn't be punished for having an accidental pregnancy.I actually think the analogy is pretty good."""	0.8860950469970703	0.6077314019203186	0.4409013092517853
190	t1_ddh4uky	SLUnatic85		I think for me it would have to be when the mother feels the baby move inside her on its own. That has to be so incredible. Ill never have that feeling. I was with my sister the first time her first born kicked. My sister in law swears she could put a remote on her stomach and the little girl would kick it off. I think for a lot of people it's seeing and hearing the love ultrasound. That heartbeat... But I can surely imagine for many it doesn't happen till the baby comes out and they can see it or hold it in their arms. But once you know in your heart the child is alive and is yours. That's what we are all arguing about. Once it is your child in your own eyes, you'd be a murderer to end it's life. I agree no one can tell you exactly when that time is but that's what you are talking about without meaning to.I don't know if you have been around newborn babies or have any of your own, but they are honestly just as parasitic weeks after birth as weeks before. They latch on to their mothers breasts and literally suck out nutrients, hardly able to see. It's not uncommon to have to clear their throat and mouth of blood shit and other bodily fluids after birth. Someone needs to physically cut the umbilical cord and tie it off or it can get infected. More then we might hope of babies need to be incubated or on breathing machines for a few hours or days, especially if they decide to come out early. Many for months can't eat solid foods even if they could find it. It's not uncommon for a newborn baby to cry itself beyond exaustion if it can feel the mothers familiar warmth and hear her specific heartbeat from its memories of the womb. Your parasite definition is odd and inhumane sounding but true to an extent. But it doesn't have to do with when a life is human and worth protecting for many. Your war and self defense idea is not relevant to an innocent child for most people including myself. A baby is not forced on a woman 99+% of the time and it's crazy to suppose otherwise. Making a baby is a known consequence of an act we chose to do. To say keeping a baby inside the mother is risking her life is not valid to me either. A human body is designed to reproduce and carry a child. Accidents and sad situations happen, as they do otherwise in life. But such is the way of things. I don't need to change your view. I think I understand it much better know and thanks for the clarification. But it rubbed me the wrong way when you stated that it doesn't matter if you think the baby is a living human or not. Because it does for many people and to start an argument based on otherwise is not going to go anywhere most of the time. Own your beliefs on when you think a human life is worth protecting. You are not in the wrong. It's been great. I do appreciate people being so open and honest.	0.3067857623100281	0.46437349915504456	0.43553605675697327

201	t1_ddf7o70	jay520	27.0	Firstly, your position is a pro-choice position, it's just a radicalized sort of pro-choice position. For example, atheists who happen to be extreme (e.g. anti-theists) don't stop being atheists.But I don't consider that to be very important. More important is this: the views that you have given thus far could all be given in support of letting unwanted babies die. Do you also hold this view?; Abortions help society....There are many reasons that we should try to minimize the number of unwanted babies.Everything here also applies to unwanted babies who are already born.; View: A fetus is essentially a form of parasite, and women deserve the ability to remove such a parasite from their bodies.I assume this is a sort of a bodily autonomy argument. It seems like you're saying something like: women have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. This gives them the right to remove parasites that are attached to their body. Therefore, since fetuses are parasites, women have the right to remove fetuses.A similar bodily autonomy argument can be given to support having the right to let babies die. You could say something like: all people have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. This gives them the right to refuse to care for others. Therefore, people have the right to refuse to care for fetuses (thus letting them die).; View: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.So what you're saying is *even if* the fetus could theoretically survive if the woman went through special surgical procedures, no woman should be forced to go through with this procedure. Instead, women should retain their right to an abortion, even if the baby could be saved (because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy).A similar case can be made for letting babies die. *Even if* a particular baby could theoretically survive if a particular individual went through a special procedure (i.e. by giving the baby to authorities), no individual should be forced to go through with this procedure. Instead, everyone should retain their right to let babies die, even if the baby could be saved (because people have a right to bodily autonomy). In conclusion, everyone should have the right to let babies die, even if the only thing you need to do is give the baby to the authorities.

Do you also hold this view?I don't, and here is the key difference. A baby that has been born is no longer directly dependent on its mothers nutrients for survival. They could get their nutrients from anywhere. Once the baby is born, giving it up for adoption is a valid option. To tie this in with my views specifically, imagine that tomorrow some technology was invented that allowed people to get fetuses out of themselves, put them in some sort of artificial womb, and let them continue their development there free from the mother. If/when this technology becomes available it will have a drastic effect on my views, but since it is not yet available I see abortion as the best option when you've got a fetus in you that you don't want.; You could say something like: all people have a right to do what they want with their own bodies. This gives them the right to refuse to care for others. Therefore, people have the right to refuse to care for fetuses (thus letting them die).Again, adoption is a thing. We actually DO have the right to refuse to care for a baby if we don't want it and it's already born.So what you're saying is even if the fetus could theoretically survive if the woman went through special surgical procedures, no woman should be forced to go through with this procedure. Instead, women should retain their right to an abortion, even if the baby could be saved (because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy).Yes.... almost. I would completely agree with it if you changed \\because the woman has a right to bodily autonomy\\"" to \\""because aborting unwanted fetuses is generally good for everyone\\"".; Further, we actually should let all unwanted babies die, because it would be good for society.Honestly from a 100% pragmatic perspective that's probably true. But that's getting off on a tangent. Keep in mind that one of the biggest differences between a fetus and a born baby is that the born baby does not pose any threat to the mother any longer (as long as she's allowed to give it up for adoption). The same cannot be said for a fetus. If we compare abortion to this hypothetical surgery that would get the baby out, it would matter a lot how risky both options are. I don't know of any such procedure that would be less risky than an abortion.

That is, abortions are *not* acceptable when the fetus can be safely removed without dying (I think this is your view, yes?). Why believe this is the case? It doesn't seem to follow based on what you've said thus far. I'll try to explain why by appealing back to an analogy you used in your OP.In your OP you said \\""*If it is moral for someone to slap a mosquito sucking their blood, then it is moral to allow a woman to abort a fetus.*\\"" Presumably you would also say that it's moral to kill a mosquito that's sucking your blood *even if* you have safe methods of removing the mosquito without killing it. Why not say the same about fetuses? You paint fetuses as parasites just like mosquitos. So why not also say: it's moral to abort (and thereby kill) a fetus in your body *even if* you have safe methods of removing the fetus without killing it. A parasite is a parasite (whether it's a fetus or a mosquito) and it doesn't seem morally relevant *how* I choose to remove it. You might say that the difference between the fetus and the mosquito is that the fetus is a person and the mosquito is not...but you have already admitted that you don't believe fetuses are persons (and you don't care if they are persons anyway).---**(I feel that this part of my post is actually more important than everything prior to this point. So feel free to ignore everything before this sentence if/when you respond)**EDIT: Actually hang on a second. In another post you say:; Standard pro-choice is generally focused on the ability for the woman to make a choice for herself (hence the name). Sorta like \\""people should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies -&gt; women are people -&gt; women should be allowed to make choices about their own bodies\\"". My view is more focused on the (almost universal) positive aspects of abortion. More like \\""aborting unwanted babies is always a good thing for society -&gt; we should be encouraging people to make choices that benefit society &gt; therefore we should be encouraging people to abort their unwanted babies\\"". Women's rights don't really factor into my view, but are a happy side effect.Why can't you say the exact same thing with regard to killing unwanted babies? Why can't you say \\"" ~~aborting~~ killing unwanted babies is always a good thing for society -&gt; we should be encouraging people to make choices that benefit society &gt; therefore we should be encouraging people to ~~abort~~ kill their unwanted babies\\"". How is this argument not exactly the same? Note that I'm saying *killing* babies, not \\""merely\\"" letting them die.Now, you might say that the difference between killing unwanted babies and aborting unwanted fetuses is this: a fetus necessarily hinders the bodily autonomy of its \\""host\\"" in a way that babies do not (i.e. you can remove the baby from your life without killing it, unlike a fetus). But, as you say in the above quote, bodily autonomy has nothing to do with your support for abortion; bodily autonomy is, as you say, \\""a happy side effect\\"". You are justifying aborting unwanted fetuses by appealing *solely* to the benefits to society. So, again, how does this not support killing unwanted babies?Or, you might say that the difference between killing unwanted babies and aborting unwanted fetuses is this: babies are persons and fetuses are not, thus killing the latter is okay but not the former. But this is not what you believe. You said in your OP that \\""*I believe that abortion should be an option even if it were unequivocally proven that a fetus were equal to a human life. Essentially, this boils down to 'I don't care if a fetus is a human or not, women should be able to abort it either way'.*\\"" So you think that killing unwanted fetuses would be okay *even if* fetuses were persons. So clearly you are okay with killing *persons*, so long as it benefits society. Why can't you say the exact same thing about unwanted babies? Why not say: killing unwanted babies benefits society, therefore we should kill unwanted babies - it doesn't matter that they are persons.So I don't see how your views don't also justify killing unwanted babies (not just letting them die, but *killing* them). I can think of two ways to justify abortions without justifying killing babies: by saying that fetuses hinder bodily autonomy, or by saying that fetuses aren't persons. But you have explicitly rejected the relevance of both of these. This, I feel, is the most interesting/important implication of your view.

215	t1_ddfnj5w	Rockmar1	7.0	"Ok, I'm going to stop quoting every part of your post because I think that it all sort of ties together, and because of that it has partially changed my view.I think that all three of your points work pretty well together. To begin with, I think that your point about the theoretical surgery that was just as safe as the abortion procedure is interesting. ; But let's run with this idea that abortions are acceptable unless their are other safe alternatives to remove the baby. That is, abortions are not acceptable when the fetus can be safely removed without dying (I think this is your view, yes?).I started thinking about it, consider a hypothetical situation where a woman does not wish to have a child. The doctor tells her that she can have the fetus removed by aborting it or by another procedure that would save its life. After the procedure, the woman would never have to see the child again because it would be taken away and given to adoptive parents before she even woke up.In this situation, I think that the most logical thing to do would be to encourage the woman to go with whichever option was safer for her, but ultimately leave the decision up to her. After all, she could also choose not to have either. I'd like to label this idea as **point 1** because it is relevant to my view being changed. The main idea is that in this situation the woman's preferences would be the only thing worth discussing (unlike a real-world scenario in which you could never have two equivalent choices - right now you've just got abortion and childbirth, both of which have very different long-term outcomes that would need to be discussed). Also, just so it's clear, by 'preferences', I mean that since the woman is having identical outcomes anyway, it's just a matter of whichever option sounds nicer to her. So in this hypothetical scenario, it is shown that the woman's personal preference should have some bearing on what we encourage her to do.But let's ignore the option of carrying the fetus to term for now because she is absolutely certain that she does not want to go through with the pregnancy. In this case, I started considering what I would feel to be the \\right\\"" choice. To me it is definitely whichever poses less risk, but then I considered the case of a tie. In this situation, it still seems to me that abortion is the right choice because of all the other benefits I have listed. To address the portion of your post I have quoted specifically, this is why I believe that abortion is still typically the better option.So this idea alone has not changed my view, but now I want to tie it in with your other points.Why can't you say the exact same thing with regard to killing unwanted babies? Why can't you say \\"" aborting killing unwanted babies is always a good thing for society -&gt; we should be encouraging people to make choices that benefit society &gt; therefore we should be encouraging people to abort kill their unwanted babies\\"". How is this argument not exactly the same? Note that I'm saying killing babies, not \\""merely\\"" letting them die.Others have joked about it but you actually make a pretty good case for killing babies :) ......but seriously though, no I am not completely heartless. I don't think that intentionally murdering an infant is in any way acceptable, or could ever be justified (except in incredibly contrived circumstances that really have no bearing on the real world. Think trolley problem stuff).; Now, you might say that the difference between killing unwanted babies and aborting unwanted fetuses is this: a fetus necessarily hinders the bodily autonomy of its \\""host\\"" in a way that babies do not (i.e. you can remove the baby from your life without killing it, unlike a fetus). But, as you say in the above quote, bodily autonomy has nothing to do with your support for abortion; bodily autonomy is, as you say, \\""a happy side effect\\"". You are justifying aborting unwanted fetuses by appealing solely to the benefits to society. So, again, how does this not support killing unwanted babies?This is also a very good point. I would like to reiterate a small bit of my view first - the part regarding the reasons for me feeling that it differs from a typical pro-choice view. I referred to my view as \\""pro-abortion\\"" because I felt that the woman's choice was more of a happy side effect than a main cause for my views on abortion.Now, with that in mind let's address your points. You're absolutely right that the difference between killing the baby and having the abortion is that the fetus is feeding off the mother. This though is why we should be informing all women about their options with abortion, so that they are aware of the potential risks that can come with the pregnancy. The reason I think we should do this is in the hopes that she chooses the abortion option because1. It benefits us2. If the baby is unwanted, it benefits the womanIt's a win-win situation. And the way it benefits her is that it removes what is essentially a parasite from her body (and life, keep in mind that babies are \\""financial parasites\\"" in a way. Not really the same thing though). I think that doctors should encourage ALL patients to remove ALL parasites from their bodies because allowing a parasite to live off you at your expense is no way to live.So here's how I sum it all up. This point demonstrates why I feel that abortion should be encouraged. The reason is because her bodily autonomy is being hindered by the fetus, and just like any other parasite it's better to be rid of it. Now remember Point 1. This point demonstrated a case in which the woman's personal preferences would be the deciding factor in which of two options should be encouraged: abortion or a fetus-removal-surgery.To sum it all up, you've demonstrated that my way of justifying abortions without justifying baby-killing is that fetuses hinder bodily autonomy. You've also demonstrated that a woman's personal preferences about her bodily autonomy could have an effect on what doctors encourage her to do in a situation where both outcomes were equally balanced. Therefore, I suppose that I can't deny that a woman's \\""choice\\"" does have a central effect on my views, and therefore my views are some form of \\""pro-choice\\"". ∆However, I'll say that with the caveat that I now feel that there should still be some sort of distinction within the field of pro-choice that would accurately distinguish these sorts of views from \\""standard pro choice\\"". Maybe rather than calling it pro-abortion, I should refer to it as \\""alt-pro-choice\\"" or something. I'll definitely think about it some more.Also, this has been a really good/productive discussion and I'm curious, did I address all of your key points in a way that you agree with?Edit: Minor grammar changes"""	0.5905922651290894	0.4926237165927887	0.4405043125152588

222	t1_ddfpo0k	jay520	27.0	&gt; Also, this has been a really good/productive discussion and I'm curious, did I address all of your key points in a way that you agree with?I probably agree mostly with your new view here. I have always thought of abortions by first defending the *right* to abortion by appealing to bodily autonomy. Then, in certain circumstances, it might be that a woman actually *should* have an abortion if it is in her interests (but again, this is only after defending the right to abortion via bodily autonomy). The obvious circumstances are when the woman's health is in danger. A less obvious circumstance is when, for example, the woman is in an unstable/impoverished position in life such that having a baby would make it extremely difficult for her, or her children, to ever escape the cycle of poverty. If it turned out that she could abort her pregnancy now and postpone children for a few years until she was able to provide a flourishing environment for her offspring, then I would probably agree that she actually should abort now (it would be in her interests and her future children's interests). But the difference between you and I are probably that (a) I'm appealing the woman's own long-term interest for determining whether she should have an abortion rather than appealing to society's interest, and (b) I don't know that these circumstances are as common as you seem to imply, but this is ultimately an empirical question. I think these are rather minor differences though which I do not find interesting. I would probably mostly agree with you on policy implication: I'm definitely in favor of removing almost all restrictions to abortion access, and I would also probably be in favor of some form of subsidized abortions (but this is more complicated because I'm not sure yet where I stand on the justification for taxation, so I'm not sure if I think subsidized abortions are a justified use of taxation).

This is obvious.It is not because society benefits from less babies, though I also think this is true, it is an argument about parent freedom immediately after birth.I'm not saying society should kill unwanted babies, like if it were left in the street. I think society should take care of babies left in the street or hospitals to the best of their ability.Also curious why there is a huge aversion to harming babies vs adults. I think there are surveys where people say they would rather kill adult humans than babies because they are innocent and helpless. I find this view ridiculous. Is this view common in the world, or just the US? Clearly many tribes stray far from this point of morality	0.0022384889889508486	0.20700111985206604	0.3802226185798645

His/her reasoning is that abortions are beneficial to the society because unwanted fetuses will likely be born into an undesirable upbringing environment. Since the motivation behind the OP's support of abortions is its benefit for the society, and since people of lower social class are less likely to be able to adequately support raising unwanted children due to their socioeconomic status, OP's view can be seen as eugenics against the lower class. Essentially, OP is saying lower class fetuses do not deserve to be born if they are unwanted and therefore have a higher chance of becoming a burden to the society.	0.9952547550201416	0.8204903602600098	0.23620501160621643

(For the record, I actually am pro-choice, but that is irrelevant). What I am arguing is that OP's stance targets a certain class of people, namely, the lower class who do are more likely to be unable to provide for an unwanted child. OP supports the encouragement of abortions of unwanted children on the basis that the society would be better off that way. I am making the comparison of this to eugenics, because they both rely on the same premise (i.e. killing off certain groups for the greater good of society)	0.00034758629044517875	0.05614877864718437	0.13297665119171143
236	t1_ddfq5xx	uname1729		I actually hold this position. And I'll try to defend it.It is not a eugenics argument because the choice is up to the person not the society, the freedom to have children is intact. You might argue that the effect is the same but I think the problem of eugenics is in its process.Also, why not sick people? I'm not for killing sick people but I don't know of I can give a good argument. One reason is that society, for it to be stable, promises a certain insurance against bad fortune in return for your contribution, voluntary or otherwise. This is definitely contradicted by killing sick people. You might argue that protecting newborns are a fundamental requirement for human society, I'd argue against. Anyways, my position is not that we should change the laws today to allow killing newborns, that would be outrageous because other people don't think like me, but I would be willing to live in such a society.	0.579697847366333	0.521767258644104	0.3492388427257538

273	t1_ddfn0tn	The-D-Man-is-awesome		This post could be helped by adding another view: the anti-natalist view. It looks like you are using Utilitarian ideas.So, let us accept three states. The state of Pain, the state of Pleasure, and the state of neither. The state of Pleasure is good, and Pain is bad, from a Utilitarian perspective.Neither ranges from good to neutral. This is because not doing a good thing is not evil but not doing a bad thing is good. Since neutral doesn't matter this implies that neither is good.This means that to be good, we should avoid the pain state.Now let's see the ranges that can exist in each stage. -------------------- | Pleasure | Pain | Neither---|---|----|----Existence | ✓| ✓ | ✓Non-Existence | ✗ | ✗ | ✓Let us now make the Good/Bad substitution.-------------------- | Good | Bad | Good---|---|----|----Existence | ✓| ✓ | ✓Non-Existence | ✗ | ✗ | ✓Therefore, existence is wrong since it creates evil. So, Abortion is right because it cancels existence and thus helps the world and individual child	0.781981348991394	0.6293306946754456	0.38166630268096924

So when I say that I'm also pro-abortion, I really mean it.I think it's great to be pro-abortion! So let's delve into what you're trying to distinguish between -- the difference between \pro-choice\\ and \pro-abortion.\\""I think we can characterize \pro-choice\\"" as being like the Bill Clinton line: that abortions should be \safe, legal, and rare.\\"" We recognize that they're necessary, but we don't feel good about them so we would also like to try preventing them.On the other hand, people who say \pro-abortion\\"" are beyond the shame stage. They're in the \on demand and without apology\\"" camp. They dislike that the \safe, legal, and rare\\"" people are making an environment in which somebody who has an abortion has still screwed up -- by having an abortion, they're making abortions less rare.Me? I work hard to provide abortions, and I also work hard to prevent them. Why do a cardiac bypass when you could prescribe a statin? Why prescribe a statin when you could encourage diet and exercise earlier in life? A late-term abortion is riskier than an early abortion is riskier than a Mirena IUD insertion.I'd like the public to be pro-abortion, but if \safe, legal, and rare\\"" is what it takes to help Catholics vote Democrat, then I'm not going to get hung up on it.---Here's where you're wrong, though: the pro-choice stance is that people should be able to choose to have an abortion. That stance includes your stance. You think you're not included because it's not the public face of the pro-choice stance. But don't worry, we're here. We're also better off having the politicians handle some parts of this.---;View: Abortions should be allowed up until birth, after which they should no longer be allowed.Allow them or not, they're not possible after birth. Abortion is something that only a pregnant person can have. After delivery, they're not pregnant anymore.The other side of what you're saying is that they should be permissible at any gestational age. I feel from your argument that you haven't matured this thought very well, which is understandable, because you're not an ob/gyn.Abortions are not a monolith. There are early D&amp;Cs, later D&amp;Es, and then feticide and induction (or, in very rare cases, feticide and cesarean birth -- for example, somebody with a complete placenta previa and fetal anomalies not compatible with life who decides that they do not want to give live birth -- it would be a weird scenario and I'm not promising that feticide/cesarean is what I'd do, but it would be worth considering).So let's say somebody comes in at 39 weeks, and you say \abortion should be offered to them.\\"" Well, they don't want to be pregnant anymore, and that's great. What would you do? Feticide and induce? The feticide would offer maternal harm (chorioamnionitis and premature rupture of membranes both increase risk of cesarean and postpartum hemorrhage; fetal demise also increases risks of postpartum hemorrhage) with no benefit. I could just induce their labor. So if something went wrong, and I were asked to defend my decision to perform a feticide prior to delivery, I would have no leg to stand on.So no, I wouldn't offer her an abortion, and I'm pretty pro-abortion.---;View: Doctors should be required to inform pregnant women about the safety and cost of abortions, as well as the safety and cost of pregnancy (including the costs of raising the child).Please do not place requirements on how I talk to my patients.Please do not try and make my patients' reproductive decisions be made under even more financial stress.As Dr. Tiller said, \trust women.\\"""	0.17931079864501953	0.4252568185329437	0.4240461587905884

281	t1_ddfk9fw	RexDraco	6.0	To sum it up very simply, you make it very clear there is some positive reasons to support abortion as a choice. You make it very clear that women should NOT be forced to have an abortion. Overall, you make it very clear you support the CHOICE to have an abortion, therefore you are pro choice. Pro Abortion would mean EVERYONE would have to have an abortion, that's what that implies, that's what that means. If you wanted to end the human race, you wouldn't be pro choice, you'd be pro abortion. Your issue is you feel like you do not belong with the majority of pro choice, therefore you wish to separate yourself from the large group. The truth is, you're listing points pro choice actively uses to push their agenda for abortion being a choice. There might be the vocal majority that makes them feel a bit distant to what you believe, but the overall majority that might not be so vocal generally believe unwanted children should be aborted, that women with potential health risks should have an abortion, and if the fetus is developing with potential risks that could transfer to the child should too be aborted. This is ALL arguments pro choice subscribes to. An example is this. You have a group of friends that wishes to play card games. You also have a group of friends that wishes to play sports. Your friends like to play sports want you to join them, but you don't really play sports so you are not really going to join them in that. Your other friends wishes to play some Yugioh, but you don't like Yugioh but prefer Magic the Gathering. Just because you don't like Yugioh, it doesn't make you any less of a card gamer. You play card games, simple as that. You say that you don't like Yugioh, which is what your friends that enjoy card games play, therefore you must not belong in that group which must mean you're neither interested in sports nor card games, therefore you're something special. The truth is, you're not special, you are more of a sub category of card gamers that doesn't match with your friends. This holds true to both sides of abortion laws. Not ALL people against pro choice are against abortion!! This is a misconception caused by poor communication and ignorance developing unnecessary generalizations. Some people against pro choice believes there should be exceptions! For example, you should not have the right to abortion, except if it means there is a danger to you or the child. Some people against pro choice thinks it should ABSOLUTELY be against the law, even if there's health dangers. Both of these would still reside under the same category, against pro choice, but they're still both VERY different. Likewise, Pro Choice too has its own sub categories. Some people believe people should have absolute control of whether or not they can have an abortion. Some will even take it as far as the man having the power to say there is going to be an abortion, some say only the women should have the right! They are VERY different, but they both fit under the same category. You too are in a sub category that fits promptly underneath pro choice. You believe in the choice of abortion, even if it's different from how others view how pro choice should be handled. Don't try to oversimplify politics by making it more complicated. Don't assume you don't belong in a group just because you don't match 100% with the more vocal individuals. Sometimes, you really are one or the other, but that doesn't mean it can't get more in depth or complicated on it each category either, there is always room for internal discussions as to how their stance should take place. One easy example is republicans versus democrats. Just because your view on republican politics is different from another, it doesn't mean you're magically not a republican, right?	0.40744808316230774	0.49130260944366455	0.44934070110321045
