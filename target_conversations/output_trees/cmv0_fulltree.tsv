0	t3_64szba	curiouscat145		I think that abortions are useful to society. I think people make mistakes even responsible and loving birth control using couples and I think these mistakes should be able to be remedied by abortions. I think that having a baby is a massive step for anyone especially in a world where it's far more difficult to have a family without sinking into poverty if you don't already have a stable income. Therefore I don't think someone should have a baby simply because other people find abortion to be disgusting. I don't think abortion is pleasant nor do I think it should be used as birth control. However, I think that in situations where people are irresponsible it makes absolutely no sense to force them to have a child and make their situation worse and force the child to have parents who did not want them and are irresponsible.	0.9912165999412537	0.7279090285301208	0.3905256390571594

46	t1_dg4weg7	Rockmar1	9.0	&gt; There is not a discrete difference between a fetus and an infant.I'd like to change your view back on this one. There definitely is a difference between the two; in fact there are a few differences.The first difference is that a fetus poses a threat to the mother's life - a newborn baby does not. Pregnancy is risky, and complications can lead to the death of the mother. A fetus, by definition, is still inside the mother so the mother will still have to deliver that fetus. That delivery process is dangerous. I feel that people have a right to remove threats to their lives from other people, and in this case I see it as no different just because the fetus happens to be inside the mother.A second difference is that adoption is an option for newborn babies. It is not an option for a fetus. What that means is that if there is an unwanted newborn baby, then the mother has non-lethal options of removing that baby from her life. She can give it up for adoption. However, with a fetus there are no non-lethal options for removing the fetus from her life. Therefore, if the mother does not wish to carry the fetus to term, abortion is the only option available to her.	0.16875872015953064	0.3633655309677124	0.40974873304367065

57	t1_dg5b4mf	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		Well in Natural Law theory, they explain that those who kill others give up their right to life since they are not innocent in respect of having a right to life. On the soldiers, the law of totality explains why a country can send soldiers to battle and the right to self defense which can also justify the deaths of one person.However, those who follow natural law(some prolife people) believe that you cannot intentionally kill someone. There always has to be a main motive, which in these cases, are justice, survival of a country, and self defense.	0.000855598715133965	0.002199411392211914	0.0027812004555016756
58	t1_dg5bba4	Rockmar1	9.0	I'm not familiar with the law of totality so I'm not sure what your second sentence means. But as far as the first sentence goes, abortion falls into that category. It's not just people who kill - it's people who are a threat. So in other words, if a guy is rushing you with a knife you don't have to wait until he stabs you for it to be ok to shoot him.All fetuses pose a threat to the mother's life. Therefore, none of them have a right to life. After they have been born, they no longer pose a threat to the mother and therefore they now have the right to life.	0.5565500259399414	0.6012786030769348	0.3710021376609802
59	t1_dg5btsv	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		Law of Totality states that the sacrifice of a part for the whole is morally justifiable. Soldiers fighting(part) for the protection of their country and people (whole) and defending themselves from their enemy(self defense threat).Yes, you could say that it is a threat. One of the Laws, the impermissibility of a pre-emptive strike cannot allow you to defend yourself unless they start to try to kill you. At that moment (in this case rushing to you with a knife), they gave up their right to life. Since you have the right to life, you have the right to defend yourself. Killing them, has to be the unintentional result of you trying to incapacitate them.However, the person themselves is not aware that they might or might not kill you, which makes the person innocent. For example, if a person was sleep walking and attempted to beat you up, since they are not aware, they are innocent because they are not aware of their actions. Therefore, they still do have the right to life since they did not intentionally pose as a threat to the mother.	0.07040248811244965	0.3083966374397278	0.3916434645652771
60	t1_dg5c38z	Rockmar1	9.0	&gt; One of the Laws, the impermissibility of a pre-emptive strike cannot allow you to defend yours unless they start to try to kill you.I would claim that the right to defend yourself should then start at the moment of conception since complications could arise at any time.; However, the person themselves is not aware that they might or might not kill you, which makes the person innocent.I think it's interesting that not being aware of their threat is enough of a reason that you feel it's not ok to abort, but the fact that they aren't aware of anything isn't a good enough reason to just abort them. They aren't aware that they are developing or that they will ever be born either. So by aborting them, you really aren't even taking anything away. Sure, you're taking a **potential** thing away, but that isn't the same thing at all.Regardless, I don't see how being aware makes any difference. Let's take your sleepwalking example. In some extreme case where someone was sleepwalking, grabbed a gun, and started shooting at me with it I would think it is perfectly acceptable to kill them. The fact that they aren't aware that they are a threat to me makes them no less of a threat after all.	0.7324180603027344	0.5941487550735474	0.3781527578830719
61	t1_dg5ckmj	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		You cannot intentionally kill a person or do something bad in order to gain something good in Natural Law.I'm actually pro-choice, but I studied ethics in Natural Law and I can reasonably understand why pro-life people believe that abortion is morally wrong. The potentiality is a good factor in justifying the morality of abortion. To the pro-life person, the fetus is another step of human development, just like the development of an infant to an adult. You are technically taking something away, which is their life, potential happiness, and future potential adulthood. Just like how you kill an infant, you take away the same things, unless that doesn't matter to you either.You have the right to self defense in that scenario. But in this case, you cannot intentionally kill them, you can shoot their knee caps or their hands, but to purposefully aim at the head or heart is wrong. But here's where I draw the line on abortion. If a person was unconscious and is going to physically torture you and they have a 1 in 2000 chance of killing you, Natural Law theorists believe that you should be physically tortured if there's no other way to stop them other than killing the person. I do not agree with that at all.	0.5238036513328552	0.4661391079425812	0.4257189631462097

72	t1_dg542yh	Tippydaug		Many people back this up by saying the baby isn't really alive solely because it can't survive outside of the womb. However, by the age of only 6 weeks, a baby typically has a heartbeat.Life: the condition that distinguishes organisms from inorganic objects and dead organisms, being manifested by growth through metabolism, reproduction, and the response to stimuli or adaptation to environment through changes originating internally.To begin in simplest terms, in abortion videos, the baby clearly responds to stimuli. The baby also grows and develops its metabolism. While it can't reproduce, neither can babies until a certain age, so that isn't quite comparable.However, you may not accept that as a living being, which is fine. That leads to my biggest argument.You stated that abortion is a helpful option to people who can't afford the child and would be sent into poverty. While I do agree keeping the child themselves would be an issue, I feel there are many options they could do before abortion. The baby could be put up for adoption or taken care of by a family member.If a women were to abort a baby herself, no matter how early on, she would be charged for murder (I know because a friend of my mother was charged for the very thing), yet doctors can do it and it is no longer murder.There are many gaps within the logic of abortion and, while I do understand why some believe it's a good option, I strongly disagree.	0.9554368257522583	0.629632830619812	0.42976754903793335

It's expensive, complicated, time consuming, etc.. People would rather use a condom or a pill but these methods don't always work. This is where abortion solves a real problem. Like it or hate it, the people didn't want a baby and I think it's simply immoral to saddle them with one."""	0.6760480999946594	0.6228601336479187	0.3499702513217926

81	t1_dg50pc5	Spoopsnloops		A morally bad or good thing is subjective and questionable. People actively believe that abortion is morally bad, which is largely why they're against it and want it to be illegal.The former determines the latter. Useful or necessary doesn't exactly factor into the sense of morality here.	0.010305078700184822	0.253689706325531	0.4259878993034363
82	t1_dg4wycc	aleph473	8.0	&gt;Socially and economically necessaryActually, there are many sectors of the economy that are benefitted by having high populations. This is why there is a high amount of political cooperation between big business and organized religion in the US: more people means more consumers means more money, at least for some people. Did you know that Target can use its algorithms to analyze a person's purchases and know, with very high accuracy, that a shopper is pregnant before even she does? Just based on tiny changes in shopping habits and behaviors. Internet companies can know with even greater certainty, just based on the subtle changes in behavior and emotion that take place *before a woman even knows that she's pregnant*. The reason they invest so much into knowing that is that people with kids consume a lot more than people without kids. There are huge, powerful companies that would stand to gain a great deal from restricting reproductive rights.	0.8753445744514465	0.7007394433021545	0.3463508188724518
