"t1_dr6153j"	"xaxxix"	NA	"\\"There's a concept called bodily autonomy. It's generally considered a human right. Bodily autonomy means a person has control over who or what uses their body, for what, and for how long. It's why you can't be forced to donate blood, tissue, or organs. Even if you're dead. Even if you'd save or improve 20 lives. It's why someone can't touch you, have sex with you, or use your body in any way without your continuous consent. A fetus is using someone's body parts. Therefore under bodily autonomy, it is there by permission, not by right. It needs a person's continuous consent. If they deny or withdraw consent, the pregnant person has a right to remove them from that moment. A fetus is equal in this regard because if I need someone else's body parts to live, they also can legally deny me their use. By saying a fetus has a right to someone's body parts until it's born, despite the pregnant person's wishes, you're doing two things:1. granting a fetus more rights to other people's bodies than any born person2. awarding a pregnant person less right's to their body than a corpse\\"-unknown source"
"t1_dr6qllq"	"djangounfazed"	NA	"&gt;A zygote/fetus is a human being Not everyone agrees with that. Most people might agree that a zygote/fetus is *alive*.But to argue that a zygote is exactly the same as a fully formed adult human is a stretch at best. If you make that argument, you are trying to argue that a zygote/fetus has the same rights as a human born.I will specifically talk about [this argument](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbNYOyPRpgg) that [the cool kids philosopher](https://static.currentaffairs.org/2017/12/the-cool-kids-philosopher) talks about, which is that you *must* draw the line that something is a human being at the conception of life, because all human life has intrinsic value. Poor kid gets is clearly unprepared for this, so I'll do my best to address it.Yes, it has the *potential* to become a human being, the same way as a person in a coma has the *potential* to become conscious. Same as a child has the potential to become an adult.But the main issue here is that all those examples *aren't* conscious adult human beings. None of those things have the same rights and privileges as an adult human being. They cannot consent to sexual activity. They can't consent to abstain from life-saving treatment (only if the comatose person had in advance written an directive). You cannot expect a fetus to have the same rights as an child, you cannot expect a fetus to have the same rights as a person in a coma, and you certainly cannot expect the fetus to have the same rights as the mother.;It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.I'm assuming that by 'moral value' you are talking about the right to life?Well, its not like 'it gains value' on tuesday rather than monday. It has a value as a potential human life. But you can't think of humanity as an absolute 'it exists or not'. Over the course of the gestation, and this is a point that most anti-choicers don't want to acknowledge, because of the uncomfortable truth, the fetus gains more humanity. You're talking about a bunch of undifferentiated cells turning into an independent life form. At week one, you don't even have a functioning digestive tract. At week 24 you have a living fetus, capable of surviving independently outside of the uterus. If you don't believe there is *any* difference between those 2 states, then why not argue there is no difference between a child and an adult? Why not give toddlers the right to vote? Why not stop treating a comatose human being, because they haven't said they want to be treated? See, when you open up the can of worms about all humans of all ages being totally equal, therefore as equally responsible, you have to argue against established human fundamental ideas about morality and ethics. At which point, you've lost."

"t1_dr404pk"	"skinbearxett"	"8"	"I've studied developmental biology a bit at university, not done yet, but here is the underlying thing I have found about the argument \\"zygote = human\\". Many things are, in certain ways, human. The cells you scrape off your cheek are human, and include all of your DNA. The cells in your sperm/egg are human but have half the regular DNA needed to make a person. A chunk of liver cells, a sixth if I recall correctly, can grow to regenerate a full liver by itself. A series of nerve cells can interact with a computer chip and perform computational operations.The question is what is a human, what test can we use to distinguish human from nonhuman. If we say consciousness then definitely zygote are out, and so are brain dead people. If we say ability to experience pain then zygotes are out, so are people with congenital insensitivity to pain. What about ability to suffer? That makes most animals human, so you would have to go full vegan to have a consistent moral position there.So eventually we have to conclude that unlike simple stories the real world has a lot of nuance, there is not always a clear right or wrong, and we have to make the best decision we can while recognising our limitations. We know for a fact that women who have an unexpected pregnancy suffer when restricted from getting an early term abortion, and there are very few late term abortions of which the vast majority are due to horrible medical issues. We also know that women who do not have access to safe, legal abortion still have abortions, just not safe legal ones. This makes them criminals, just as the drug war makes drug users criminals. Take away the crimes and risks and you have a happier, healthier society, and we can definitely measure that."
"t1_dr40fvb"	"TheWinkAndTheGun"	NA	"&gt; A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).I suspect this has less to do with the baby itself and more to do with the relationship between the mother and the baby.By that, I mean, can we isolate the morality of the one from the other when considering abortion? Or are the stories stronger because the combined mother/baby is more powerful emotionally to consider? That the mother is risking her life, depending on various health factors, to bring a child into the world and both are in a vulnerable state while this happens.With abortion, the woman has power to end the pregnancy, effectively taking back full control of her body. Without abortion, the woman has no power over pregnancy and the growing fetus could be said to have more power over her body than she does (though it doesn't have any conscious power), even though the woman may never have taken steps toward having a fetus grow inside her in the first place (ex: in cases of rape).Consider a world where abortion is physically impossible. If this were the case, a woman could be raped, get pregnant, and have to go through nine months of pregnancy, including the physical, mental, and emotional toll that is involved, and the risk of dying during childbirth. And even if she lives, she will now have the responsibility of raising that child thrust upon her. Or giving it up for adoption, where the responsibility is now thrust upon someone else.In reality, abortion is possible, so then choice comes into play. Whose choice should it be and when? I think most women wanting to get an abortion would desire to get one as soon as they find out they are pregnant. Choosing to carry one all the way to late term and then aborting it would be a lot of toll on the mother for no reason.As far as I'm aware, the cases where people abort later in a term is because they were unable to get access to abortion sooner.So part of what I'm saying is, even if we consider that first step of \\"I'm pregnant\\" to be a human life, there is still the dynamic of power to consider. That the woman without the option is handing over control of her body to a new human for the next nine months and may be giving up her life in the process.I'll end with a hypothetical: Say a woman gets pregnant and we can see her future, and know that no matter what we do, she is going to die in childbirth if she carries the baby to full term. My question with this hypothetical is, would that knowledge change the morality of the situation, since we know that the life of one will result in the death of the other?"
"t1_dr40gqf"	"fargmania"	NA	"This is an endlessly debatable topic that has no good answer because it depends on varying definitions of life and morality, which are at their heart subjective constructs of a civilized society.The question we should be addressing first, is at what point does the potential life of the child actually become more important than the actual fully formed life of the mother? Both the mother and the child have a stake in the creation of a life, and both beings have inherent rights. So which one gets more of a right to live freely in a case of dispute between the two? Let me give you an example of what I mean...My cat has rights... primarily she has the right to live in my household without imposed suffering. If I violate that right and cause her suffering, I am subject to fines or jailtime and will likely be barred from keeping cats in the future... so clearly the cat has limited rights in society to a pleasant life. And yet with no reason more than inconvenience... I can take my cat down to the vet and have her \\"humanely\\" killed for a reasonable fee. Clearly my life is valued by society more than the cat's. I am allowed to kill her on a whim... so long as I do it without causing suffering.So where do we draw that line with a human fetus? There is a point in time where it is far far less alive and less smart than a cat, and there is a point in time where it is smarter but still more helpless and vulnerable than a cat, and there is a time where it could be considered fully human. I personally put the \\"fully human\\" definition at about two years of age, which is when the human brain reaches a stage of development where cognitive function is formed enough to turn simple vocabulary and concepts into complex thought streams and sentences. When the islands of brain function grow bridges and interconnect. This is the point where a human being becomes fully self-aware, and leaves the simple thought processes of other animals in the dust as intelligence and flexibility grow exponentially from that point forward. But does that mean we should be allowed to abort a child even after they leave the womb? Does a one year old have any more right to life than a fetus? Any less of a right to life than an adult? These are the questions that need addressing... not the question of \\"when does life begin\\" but \\"when does that life become more important than the other life\\"Abortion isn't an immoral act until we can all agree on which of the competing lifeforms has more rights. The blastocoel of human tissue that has more in common with egg yolk than a person... or the fully formed and contributing member of society who would like to choose her destiny rather than have society choose it for her. My vote is that the mom has more rights through most of the pregnancy, and as such... it is perfectly moral for her to choose what happens to her body. In my state the cutoff for abortion is for as soon as the fetus could survive outside the womb, which is up to about 24-26 weeks. It seems like a reasonable cutoff to me. Anything longer than that... and I'd have to say that culture would need some new definitions on morality and murder to justify it.As a final note... I love my cat... and I am pro-cat."
"t1_dr44r0m"	"HazelGhost"	"4"	"&gt;Even among pro-choice advocates, most probably would agree that it is immoral to kill human beings.I think this is only due to a lot of vague baggage around the phrase \\"human being\\". Case in point: by the definition proposed (i.e., simply being alive and having unique human DNA qualifies you to be a human being), partially absorbed twins are still human beings, making it murder to remove, say, an unusable third arm.;We refer to the zygote/fetus as \\"the child\\", \\"the baby\\", etc... I don't. And I especially don't hear that phraseology used on individual fertilized eggs (does *anybody* say \\"This petri dish holds eight babies.\\"?);Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).This only happens very late in the pregnancy, when it's much easier to see the fetus as a baby. The vast majority of abortions take place early on in pregnancy, when it's very difficult to do so.;Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth.Yes, but most people really don't care about lost fertilized eggs. Your average couple that has children will lose just as many fertilized eggs during their attempts. Where are the funerals for these eggs? Again, this seems like a case of \\"late vs early\\".;It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.I agree! But it's also illogical to think that a sperm and egg separated have no moral value, and suddenly gain as much (or even more) moral value when they touch. The uncomfortable truth is that the most natural conclusion is to think that the fetus gains moral worth as it grows, having almost no moral worth as an egg or blastocyst (when most abortions happen), having more moral worth as a fetus, and finally having equal 'human' moral worth as a newborn.Those are my thoughts, at least!"
"t1_dr450zu"	"Reinheitsgebooot"	NA	"&gt; There is plenty of reason to suggest that a zygote/fetus is not a person, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't a human beingWhy not? What difference is there between a sperm and egg a moment just before fertilization and a moment after?The chromosomal argument gets you in trouble, the zygote is not viable, and the biology has only just met one milestone out of many, many more that it must undertake to be a viable human, that many zygotes do not make it to. ; Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).This really isn't an issue as rarely any abortions happen at the time when a dying (or otherwise) mother could give birth to a **viable** baby. In fact the vast majority of abortions happen in the first trimester.http://www.foxnews.com/story/2003/06/17/fast-facts-us-abortion-statistics.html; Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.Again, not an actual concern or issue. ; It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.Exactly my point! Now apply this logic to one moment prior to conception, and one moment after. If you remain consistent with this position then you must accept that sperm and eggs a moment prior to conception, and the diploid cell they become/are a moment after, carry the same value.Meaning, you must either accept that recently fertilized zygotes are essentially value-less (as much as constantly discarded unfertilized sperm/eggs can be valued, anyway), or, you must advocate that we value all sperm and unfertilized eggs as we do newborns. If this dichotomy sounds silly to you (as it should), then perhaps a more realistic moral outlook on the progression of pregnancy and abortion is more of a greyscale between conception and birth, with nearly all abortions occurring on the more moral side of that scale."
"t1_dr45g2n"	"_Project2501"	NA	"A fertilized cell if left to its own devices without interference will grow into a human. This means that even if a fertilized cell isn’t human, it has the potential of being human. This is important.Where do you draw the line between human and not human? Drawing breath? Sentience? A heartbeat? The problem with any line you draw, it creates a standard that can be applied to all humans. Heartbeat? So the it’s okay to kill people who have pacemakers, or artificial hearts? Sentience? What if you’re sleeping? What if you’re in a coma? Can I kill you then?Drawing breath? So I can shoot you while you’re underwater?There is no way to separate a fertilized cell from a human. If you create a standard to judge what is human and not human, then by definition it applies to all humans - adult, child, fetus, zygote, or a single cell. This is why it’s immoral, and I argue that you should not be pro-choice. The only possible reason that abortion can be justified is if the life of the mother or child is endangered by the pregnancy."
"t1_dr4qp37"	"Durzio"	NA	"I disagree with you. A sleeping person is still sentient. There is a difference between unconscious and inanimate. Just because they aren’t aware due to sleep doesn’t mean that they don’t have functioning brains. In fact, the brain is still active during sleep, and some people hear things while in a coma. I would say that sentience is the line. A zygote is still just a clump of cells, and the potential for human life is not equivalent to human life."

"t1_dr4qlgb"	"Durzio"	NA	"This is a decent argument for the legalizing abortion. It’s not the laws job to decide morality. That’s too much of a slippery slope. There is no absolute morality, it’s all subjective and based on culture.That said however, I believe the question was about the morality, not the legality."
"t1_dr45x34"	"Polychrist"	"6"	"I think there are a few things which are important to discuss here,First, as posed, it sounds as if you are saying abortion is *always* immoral. Saying it is *sometimes* immoral is not something, I think, that many if any people would disagree with. So all that needs to be offered to discredit your position is one singular example of an abortion being morally justified.Second, there are many, many ethical theories out there, and whether a given act is moral or not depends on the system you are utilizing. For example, an egoist would say that you are morally required do what’s in your own interest, so if it’s in your interest to get an abortion, you morally *ought to.* Utilitarians, in turn care only about the consequences of your actions, not the nature of the actions themselves. So, a utilitarian would say that it’s morally required to have an abortion if global utility is maximized by doing so (for example, if the world were overpopulating and it would likely starve anyway).However; assuming you do not adhere to either of those philosophies, or any specific philosophy, but are instead looking for a general “golden rule” perspective, i think a good question to start with is: is it ever morally acceptable to kill any animal? If so, why? If not, why not?You claim that it is wrong to kill a human being, but also note that a biological human is something different from a human being. What, then, is the status of a biological human zygote compared to a fully grown adult cow? Is it always immoral to kill a cow for food, and if so, are we not supposed to eat meat? I will assume this is not your position. If it is okay to kill a cow for our own benefit, why can we not kill a human-in-name-only clump of cells for our benefit? Surely, we shouldn’t say that *just because* many people refer to this clump of cells as a “baby,” we should give it special status. So instead we must differentiate, perhaps by saying that unlike cows, biological humans have *an inalienable right to life.* Finally, we are getting to the points that others have made. When does this right begin, and how strong of a right is it? You seem to agree that there is no *right* to someone else’s body or property, which is why you wouldn’t outlaw abortion. So why then is it any more morally acceptable to kill a cow than to abort a zygote, given that the cow, arguably, is at least not *reliant* upon another being for survival. If you want to see the perfectly moral person as someone who would never kill an animal or eat meat, someone who would open his home to as many of the homeless as he could fit, give endlessly, own nothing,And spend their whole life as a slave to the needs of others, then you should read Singer’s philosophy. He proposes much the same. But if you’re looking for more of an everyday philosophy based more on “do no unnecessary harm” and “treat your neighbor justly,” I don’t think abortion can be written off as immoral. At the beginning of this post i mentioned that you really only need one case of a moral abortion to counteract your position, so I’ll conclude with a few examples:Ex. 1) The zygote/fetus has a known serious birth defect, which will give them a very short painful life if carried to term.Ex. 2) the fetus is unlikely to survive childbirth, and it will endanger the mother if carried to term.Ex. 3) the mother is extremely young, and carrying the child to term would be traumatizing and dangerous.TL;DR: there are many different ethical philosophies, and which one you adhere to affects whether any action (including abortion) is acceptable or not. Based on the framing, you only need one example of a case where abortion is a moral thing to do; the case of a fetus with a detrimental defect is one such case."
"t1_dr47ai8"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"&gt; First, as posed, it sounds as if you are saying abortion is always immoral. Saying it is sometimes immoral is not something, I think, that many if any people would disagree with.I wouldn't say like 100% literally always; probably should be an almost in there. But if society at large thinks it's sometimes immoral, then why is the debate never framed in a \\"when is it acceptable to abort...\\" way? It's always binary, which suggests the two sides aren't willing to budge at all.My view would be completely different if the thinking was something like *before 5 months legal, after 5 months illegal* and the two sides were debating about increasing/decreasing this limit.One important thing is that my view isn't really about what is/should be moral, but rather what society views as moral/immoral. Our society appears to place special moral value on zygotes and fetuses.If 87% of society thinks X is immoral, but I don't personally agree, that doesn't mean X isn't immoral. Morality is determined by our culture."
"t1_dr493qi"	"Polychrist"	"6"	"I think you must have misheard the debate, then. Many pro choice proponents support measures such as “not moral after the second trimester,” or similar. Likewise, many (not all) in the pro life camp admit that it is permissible in cases of rape and incest. Also, you can’t use societal statistics of what is accepted as moral as a standard and get consistent results (that’s probably where you’re having trouble). And I *certainly* don’t think there’s a consensus that it is immoral to abort a zygote one month into pregnancy. Really, if you want to rely on statistics, this article {https://www.vox.com/a/abortion-decision-statistics-opinions} conducted a survey and found that a mere 26% of respondents were staunchly pro life. In other words, I think you are misinformed... There doesn’t seem to be overwhelming support that a fetus has “special” moral value."
"t1_dr4mec2"	"yr8ebainbery"	NA	"If it doesn’t have any special moral value, then, in your eyes, should abortions be an acceptable form of birth control?"
"t1_dr4pu38"	"cardboard-kansio"	NA	"&gt; “not moral after the second trimester,” or similar; should abortions be an acceptable form of birth control?Not original commenter, but yes, under these conditions I would say that they are an acceptable form of birth control at a particular point.As mentioned above, women can become pregnant for many reasons: rape or incest, poor life choices, lack of education, or unexpected hardships such as the death or departure of a spouse shortly after impregnation. In these cases, women may not be in reasonable physical, mental, emotional, or financial circumstances to carry a baby to term, let alone to care for it.In situations like these, it's a huge personal risk as well as a societal burden to *force* the child to be born and then have it raised by the state or in foster care."
"t1_dr6bxv0"	"yr8ebainbery"	NA	"I get that sometimess a woman needs to have an abortion.Maybe 1-3 times in their lifetime. But if a woman is using it regularly as a form of birth control, wouldn’t that raise concerns?"

"t1_dr6ze7s"	"Polychrist"	"6"	"It would be exponentially more expensive to use abortion (even in pill form) as contraception on a regular basis compared to standard birth control pills.

"t1_dr70b1a"	"Polychrist"	"6"	"If she lost her keys, I would expect for her to find them again, as many people lose their keys everyday and in fact, do find them again. So we would care more about miscarriage because that loss is permanent. A better analogy would be to consider whether we would be “extra” sad if she lost the urn containing her grandfathers ashes in a shipwreck, and I think that people in general would be. People do not see losing the ashes as a loss of life. But people do still feel sad, because the ashes meant something, represented something, that in a perfect world she would have preserved. If the miscarriage was not self-induced, we can assume it is a meaningful loss to her.Alternatively... think of how we feel about a woman who scatters her grandfathers ashes at sea after his passing. Do we feel extra sad for her? For the ashes? I don’t think so. We think, “yeah, maybe things could’ve been different, and she wouldn’t have to do anything with the ashes at all, but she is here, and does have to do something with them, and maybe this isn’t such a horrible thing to do.”If the woman chooses to put the ashes to sea, we are significantly less sad than if the ashes were *lost* at sea. We feel sorry for the *woman* in the first case, not for the fate of the ashes themselves. Likewise with the mother and her would-be child.Edit: italics"

How far along was the baby? Did she want it?Your question assumes some if the answers, and does not cover every case. There is an assumption on the part of the bystander that the woman will care of course, and this is a good gamble: it's more common and the false positive has a much lower cost than the false negative.;It's not like she can't just make another one (we don't see it that way).Depends who you ask. Ofc for some who is relatively infertile it can be more sad."
"t1_dr56j11"	"BiPoLaRadiation"	NA	"For the vast majority of losses this is exactly the case. Most occur very early in pregnancy or even before the zygote implants on the uterine wall. Many do not even realize they are pregnant. This is why pregnant couples do not talk about pregnancy or having a child until after the first trimester. Why do people still morn these losses? Because raising a healthy baby takes months. And even 2 months of knowing you are pregnant means doctors visits, vitamins, lifestyle changes, and so on in preparation for a future with a child which itself brings a large number of mental and emotional changes. To have that future interupted is traumatizing not because the barely a fetus suffers or was ever going to make it but because you were already living life as if you had a child both in your goals and future ideals as well as your current actions. When your goals and dreams are taken away it is painful and it is easy to blame yourself especially with all the hormone changes."

Second, neither OP nor I is having this discussion to debate the morality of eating meat. Presumably, if killing of any sort (including animals) is considered wrong by OP, OP would have included that in the initial rationale for their position. In fact, OP suggests that “morality is just what the people agree it is,” indicating that at least in the western world, eating eat is permissible. If OP changes position on this, *then* I will be willing to discuss the morality of vegetarianism in this forum.Now, I’m not going to respond to each quote you misunderstood, but keep in mind that context matters. We are having a discussion here; it is impossible to know which moral philosophy OP adheres to, so it is not “relativistic” to offer some alternative interpretations. It’s impossible to answer a question until you know what the asker is asking. If you are so intent on discussing moral philosophy in general, without regard to the specific case at hand, or if you are interested in discussing and discovering how and why some people feel justified in eating meat, I encourage you to start your own CMV and discuss it there."
"t1_dr45zzc"	"AddemF"	NA	"I don't see a reason to call a zygote a human being. If we assert that it is, and it is merely a clump of cells with human DNA but has no other features we would generally recognize as features of a human being, then why stop at a zygote? Are sperm and eggs human beings? I also don't accept the implication that it is always immoral to kill human beings. Suppose a human is hooked up to you by IV for life support, but you never consented to be hooked up to this person. You have the right to pull out the IV and go live your life.In regard to your point about the fetus having no moral value one minute and then as soon as it's born having full moral value: Few people hold this belief, and instead most believe that other events indicate the beginning of moral value like a heart-beat or brain activity; or they think that moral value increases gradually over time."
"t1_dr46zxu"	"ZeusThunder369"	"7"	"An important difference between a zygote and sperm is that, short of extreme circumstances, we know the zygote will develop into a person.I agree that I have the right to do so, but that doesn't mean the act wouldn't always be morally neutral.; Few people hold this belief, and instead most believe that other events indicate the beginning of moral value like a heart-beat or brain activity; or they think that moral value increases gradually over time.If that's true, then the framing of the abortion debate doesn't suppor that.

"t1_dr5hhe5"	"AddemF"	NA	"True, although it seems very unmotivated to hold the general principle:If x will develop into a person under most normal circumstances, then x is human. Generally I think we would define a human by typically human characteristics: It walks around, reasons, talks, metabolizes food, and so on. The farther you are from these properties, the less willing we are to call you a human. I think a zygote is extremely far from these, not much closer than bacteria, so that it is a huge stretch to call it a human. And in fact, when we think about why it is so horrible to kill a baby, I think this is mostly for the sake of the mother who loves it, not because the baby intrinsically has so much extra moral value. And in fact, I think most mature debates about abortion in fact are about the point at which it is appropriate to abort, but because both sides hyperventilate about the topic, the conversations never get nuanced or civil enough to have that conversation. The truth is that when pro-choice people advocate for the freedom to abort, they typically have in mind a pregnancy in the first few weeks or months. When an anti-choice advocate argues against abortion, they typically have in mind a being that is visibly in human form. Then they proceed to yell at each other, assuming that the other is sharing the same mental picture and not being appropriately responsive to the moral implications."

"t1_dr476pn"	"YcantweBfrients"	"1"	"&gt; Even among pro-choice advocates, most probably would agree; We refer; extra sadness or outrage from our society; a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).; Most people would be appalledIMO your biggest mistake with this whole thing is making the issue about what other people think. If, as I gather from your \\"Explanation of title\\", it's not about what the laws should be (aka what we need to agree upon as a society), there is no way or reason to apply the \\"logic\\" of a society's views as a whole. *You* decide what *you* think about this issue and why. You don't have to use assumptions you perceive \\"our society\\" making to do so. What are *your* assumptions?Given that, I don't think I can tell you what your personal beliefs are or should be, but I can share mine to illustrate my thought process on this. I personally value different forms of life on a spectrum. Animals are generally above plants, smart animals are generally above dumb animals, and humans are generally above the rest, though there can be exceptions to any of these. Similarly, I don't consider all forms of human life equal. As others have suggested here, I would generally value a young child over a fetus or zygote. However, many people have a hard time reconciling the idea that a baby instantly multiplies in value when it leaves the womb, so they retroactively attribute value to the fetus. I go the other way. I think a newborn has very little \\"inherent\\" value as a living entity, leaving aside how highly it's valued by its parents for personal reasons. I personally am just as fine with a mother and father deciding to kill their newborn the moment it is born as I am with a mother getting an abortion. I don't think I would call this a \\"morally neutral\\" decision, but its immorality is low enough that there are many legitimate reasons to justify it, including that raising a child is a great financial and emotional burden.I could go into more detail on my reasons and when I think it's no longer somewhat ok for parents to murder their child in cold blood, but the point is that clearly I have formed this opinion without much regard for what society has agreed upon. This doesn't mean I would act on my opinions without considering the conventions of society, but that's a different matter. I suggest you take a similar approach and see if the issue is any easier to sort out."
"t1_dr47mnf"	"BoozeoisPig"	"3"	"It comes down to how you define \\"human being\\". If you define \\"human being\\" as an organic system that is made up of tissues containing human DNA, then I would assert that killing a \\"human being\\" is not necessarily wrong.As far as \\"objective morality\\" goes I both don't think that morality is objective, but I am also an \\"objective morality non-cognitivist\\" because I don't even understand what it means to say that morality can exist outside of subjective opinion on what ought to happen.I believe that what ought to happen is that we establish a utilitarian standard of reciprocity among all of the organisms that can cause extraordinary frustration to human civilization if not respected within that standard, but can be made to not cause that frustration if they are shown that respect. And we should actively pursue a mindset against extending this standard of reciprocity to those it will do no good for the rest of human civilization to extend such a standard of reciprocity. Regarding fetuses, this would mean that because we have limited resources with which to invest into raising new people for this civilization, we ought to allow ourselves to terminate any fetus who is too likely to cause to much damage to the utility of civilization, because they do not yet have the capability to frustrate society.This standard of what is \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" is no more or less true than any other, because what is \\"right\\" and \\"wrong\\" can only be definitions which are only as true as any individual or group of individuals says it is. But I think it is obviously the best standard because it is plainly obvious that we will do much better as a society when we liberally apply artificial selection to which conceived children come to term and which do not. This is because we reproduce FAR under our total potential capacity to reproduce. We COULD create way more babies than we do, and the fact that we avoid pregnancy results in almost the exact same consequence as abortion: fewer babies are born than could have been.It is ridiculous to make any moral distinction between abortion and prevention of conception other than to appeal to your feelings, in which case it is not about the fetus, it is about you. But if it is about you and all of the rest of society, which has the awareness to react to the death of a fetus, and the capability to frustrate society if we kill them, then we have to look at whether society would be more frustrated if we killed fetuses or not, and as I said, the answer is that society is clearly less frustrated when we kill fetuses that would otherwise be born as burdens."
"t1_dr47nvs"	"_Bugsy_"	NA	"To clarify, what would it take to change your view?

"t1_dr481m9"	"Jsin14"	"1"	"I'm the opposite of you, I am pro-life, but find it hard to reconcile the concept of how we treat miscarriages from abortions before 20 weeks.No one has a funeral or names a miscarriage, but after 20 weeks they do, when it is called a stillbirth.Our current law does not give abortions on demand. There needs to be some reason after 24 weeks (in some states and being challenged 20 weeks) in many states. Sometimes this excuse may be flimsy, like a mother doesn't think she can mentally handle the pregnancy or raising a child, while others may have very real physical threats to the mother.The majority reason for abortions are unknown both to the political nature of the issue and how it is taboo to talk about it. Are most done because of rape, incest, or health to the mother? Are most done very early in the pregnancy as birth control or later due to a diagnosis of down's syndrome? Someone will try to jump in with a statistic here, and I'm sure there will be statistics that counter it on the other side.One way I've tried to comprehend this is that we live not only in space, but also time. A fetus is different from a mole or a hair in that it will eventually be a person, and has no say at that early time whether he/she/it can grow.Likewise, we have troubles with what to do with people that are elderly and may have Alzheimer's, have some form of life support, or just a diminished capacity such as blindness or pain. Do they have the right to end their life, even if it is just because they don't like having tendinitis? If they can't make the decision, can a loved one actively (not passively like removing life support) direct their death?I don't know the answers, but I do know we don't bury or name miscarriages. Guess that's a CMV from the other side."
"t1_dr4850h"	"cookiebootz"	NA	"&gt;Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.Because this is excessive. If a woman was several days from her due date and wanted to not be pregnant, she wouldn't have to get an abortion, she could get an elective delivery. Earlier in a pregnancy, no such option exists. Abortion is the least excessive way someone who doesn't want to be pregnant can maintain their physical autonomy.

Pregnancy, as much as we’d like to believe otherwise, isn’t completely safe; there are risks. Even in the US, we have one of the highest rates in the developed world for maternal mortality rate. To take away the right to a safe and legal abortion is to strip women of their human right to bodily autonomy is an immoral decision.

I used to share your view as it seemed the most scientific, but when I learned about Mirena IUDs, my personal view changed...A Mirena IUD primarily works by preventing a fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus wall. It also prevents sperm from fertilizing the egg, but this is considerably less effective and not the primary prevention mechanism. I bring this up because doctors (the ones I know at least) when referring to the fertilized egg generally call it a preganancy (ex I've been told \\"the IUD removes the pregnancy\\"). It is however almost impossible to know whether a pregnancy was prevented by preventing the sperm from reaching the egg or preventing the fertilized egg from attaching to the uterus wall, and so I would be curious to know your view on this?

"t1_dr4azz7"	"hippiekyle"	"1"	"I used to be pro-life and had a similar mindset. What changed my mind was the utilitarian approach. Does abortion benefit society? Now, obviously, this isn’t true as a blanket statement. But I was reading the book “Collapse” by Jared Diamond, the author of “Guns, Germs, and Steel”. It talked about societies that used all of their resources and ended up dying off. He wasn’t at all advocating for abortion rights, but he did mention that some tribes were convinced that infanticide was wrong by missionaries and that may have contributed slightly to their downfall. Now, I’m not advocating for infanticide, but I do think it’s worth pointing out that in some extreme cases, unrestrained birth could lead to the downfall of society. For now, it’ll likely cause some minor negative effects. An increase in teenage parents that aren’t prepared to raise a child will increase poverty rates which can possibly lead to crime and drug use. Or what about drug addicted parents that’ll neglect and/or abuse their children? I don’t think this is always the case, and I don’t think abortion should be taken lightly, but I do think it should be up to the mother to decide what is the best choice in her circumstance. It’s a sliding scale with a wide range of circumstances to consider. If you frame abortion as murdering babies, then of course everyone will think it’s immoral, but if you frame it as ending a potential life for the benefit of society as a whole, then you might start to question it. It’s a complicated decision that no one wants to make, but I wouldn’t say that it’s inherently immoral."

The same thing with the 21 year requirement for alcohol, the 16 year requirement for driving (in most states), the age of consent, etc. These are not perfect lines but we have to establish lines and definitions at some point. If not, we'll have ten year olds smoking and Roy Moore dating middle schoolers (legally).Most people believe that somewhere between the first cell division and birth there should be a line.

Her name was Henrietta Lacks.We regularly grow clusters of her cells up to several million cells in size.Is this a \\"human being\\"?What defines a human being?Does a zygote which is just a few dozen, or even a few thousand cells constitute \\"more human\\" than one of these cancer research cultures?How do you even define it? Is it about \\"potential human-ness\\"? If so, why aren't sperm equally as human? How about the vast majority of fertilized eggs that women simply slough due to it being the wrong time of month, or having an especially vigorous workout a few days after unprotected sex? She doesn't even realize that she terminated a zygote when she does it.Almost 50% of zygotes are spontaneously terminated by female's bodies for one reason or another.How does your assumption come to reality?"

"t1_dr4g26j"	"cassius_longinus"	NA	"The difference between murdering a human who was delivered to term and \\"murdering\\" a zygote/embryo/fetus is that the post-natal human no longer requires the environment inside his/her mother's womb to survive. A unwanted live child can be put up for adoption. The unwanted unborn child requires the use of the mother's body, which she has no obligation to grant. I see abortion not as \\"murder\\" but as an eviction from the womb which the zygote/embryo/fetus cannot survive. The woman is essentially saying, \\"Sorry, potential person, but I do not grant you permission to use my uterus.\\"A zygote/embryo/fetus has no more right to the use of a woman's womb than someone dying of kidney failure has to another person's kidneys or a hemophiliac to another person's blood. It is an incredibly compassionate and self-less gesture when a healthy person donates part of their body to another person in order to help them live (or come into existence) but it is never an obligation to do so. Therefore, we would not call someone who declines to undergo an operation to help save the life of another a murderer, even if they are the only potential donor, because of their right to bodily autonomy."

"t1_dr4h18r"	"ThinknBoutStuff"	NA	"&gt; A zygote/fetus is a human being --&gt; It is immoral to kill human beings --&gt; Thus an abortion is immoral.1) Your bullet points 1-3 act as if morality is determined by popular treatment of certain words or phrases. Certainly a prevailing idea might call us to further examine it's moral weight, but that a lot of people think a certain way isn't a logical justification. Unless you're suggesting that morality is by definition popular consensus, these points don't really give us any insight as to whether we should adopt the first point. Certainly minorities were once considered by many not to be human. I hope that's not wrong today merely on the grounds of social consensus.2) Secondly, it's even MORE unclear that it is immoral to kill human beings. We justly kill human beings all the time. Assisted-suicide and self-defense are probably the lesser controversial manifestations of moral human killings. But to an extent we can throw wartime killings and capital punishment in the ring for potentially moral ways we kill humans. Even if we did consider a fetus a person, it's not entirely out of the question that this killing could be one of those justified killings. Not to mention, if morality is merely consensus, surely abortion is not immoral right off the bat either. Many people agree that killing fetuses is just dandy.3) Your 4th bullet point doesn't follow. At one moment a person is not a citizen of a nation, when they are naturalized/sworn in, they are a citizen. That has all sorts of political and moral implications. When I sign a contract, at one moment I was not obligated while at the next I am now obligated to certain terms. Surely, the fact that a fetus must depend on the mother's body for survival, and then at another moment the fetus does not (and is no longer a fetus mind you) is a clear potential reason from biology that we ought to think of these circumstances in a different light. Ultimately, I think you're utilizing an underdeveloped and inconsistent conception of morality, which just makes the entire argument fall flat."

"t1_dr4h6vh"	"Angdrambor"	"1"	"I think there is a strong tendancy to conflate the ideas of \\"personhood\\" with \\"humanity\\". While I agree with you that a zygote/fetus is a human being with a distinct genetic identity, I don't think that it is any more immoral to kill humans than it is to kill any other animal. Why should our species have special moral standing? The immorality of murder, then, comes not from killing a human, but from killing a *person*.I believe much of the weight that we place upon the unborn is because of thier potential, and the hopes of their parents and those in their community. Humans are k-strategists, and we are programmed to put a lot of emotional weight onto our young, even before they are born. This is part of why a miscarriage is often so very devastating. The anticipation of having a child can be as charged and dramatic as the child itself. This is a very real source of moral value. It's important that we respect our instincts and acknowledge them, rather than trying to pretend to be perfectly logical. It's likewise important to note, however, that this moral value is extrinsic to the zygote - rather than something about the zygote specifically, this is a moral value that comes from the people around it: the mother, the father, the society, and thus this moral value can be highly variable. Sometimes a mother may not want children, or perhaps a family wants children but not yet, and instead of the joyful anticipation, there is a dread or fear or patient desire to only have a child when the parents are best positioned to raise it. This, this extrinsic value can be negated or contradicted.; Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.We would certainly prefer that everyone be deliberate in the way they live their life, but it doesn't always work out that way. However, since I believe that the primary moral value of humans comes from thier personhood, I *do* think that a late-term abortion is more immoral than an early one. We don't really know at what point a human becomes a person, but we do know that personhood is in the brain. Once a fetus has developed a brain, there is a chance that it might be a person, and killing it is immoral in proportion to that chance. I definitely don't think abortion is a morally neutral act. I feel that the moral cost of killing a fetus must be weighed against the moral cost of forcing a woman to use her body to support another human, and the moral cost of bringing a person into a life situation where they cannot be nurtured as they should be. These are deeply personal issues, which is why I feel the choice must be made by the mother."

I think you'd talk about things like \\"human beings can feel pain and pleasure, and have interests, and are sufficiently intelligent\\".

However, I can kill a person if it is in the defence of my own life (unless of course you live in Canada where the prevailing legal opinion seems to be that if some is trying to kill you, you should really be polite about it and die), and it is not considered immoral.

"t1_dr4mmfu"	"hargleblargle"	NA	"I think you may be able to come to a consistent point of view here by employing a more complex breakdown of the moral status of an act. Here's what I mean:You have framed your argument in terms of what is moral and what is immoral. There are many other ways of ascribing moral content to an act. A system that I encountered in University included the categories of morally impermissible, morally wrong, morally permissible, morally right, morally obligatory, and amoral. The basic understanding is that the morally obligatory is always permissible and right; the morally right is also permissible, but may not be necessarily obligatory; the morally permissible may not always be right or obligatory, but is allowed in certain circumstances even if it is sometimes wrong; the morally wrong is never right or obligatory, but may be permissible in some cases; the morally impermissible is always wrong and never obligatory, right, or permissible; and the amoral is simply devoid of moral contents.Regarding abortion, I see two ways to approach it without treating it as morally wrong or impermissible (in other words, immoral) or morally right or obligatory (moral, in your terms). You could either consider it to be amoral or morally permissible. Amoral is probably harder to argue for, because it seems very difficult to divest the act of abortion from some kind of moral contents. I have personally never found a convincing way to do this myself, so I don't think I'll try here.However, it seems to me that early term abortion is morally permissible at minimum. There may even be cases when it is morally right or obligatory, though that should most likely be decided on an individual basis. Simple examples of cases where early term abortion is morally permissible generally include pregnancies resulting from rape and pregnancies in young girls. Such a system even allows you to believe that some abortions, such as late term or 'selfish' abortions, are wrong or possibly impermissible without being inconsistent.TL;DR: A more nuanced take on morality can keep your views consistent even if they seem at odds from a more simplistic perspective."
"t1_dr4mpqr"	"RexDraco"	"7"	"I will first agree with your initial argument. They are living things, though not fully developed with intelligence it is a living little child. We find animal abuse as wrong, even to animals with virtually no intelligence, therefore why not a fetus? We also take care of people in a vegetable state, sometimes having no movement or intelligence left that even a fetus surpasses in. What's the difference?Game theory. Living creatures already have a life without consequence to others. Sometimes there is a burden put on a family that causes them to pull the plug on someone of great importance to their family, typically financially or moral obligations are tested in these situations. My uncle, for example, was an intellectual that one day fell and slammed his head on concrete. It was so severe he lost all identity, he could barely feel pain in parts of his body, had no personality, his soul is gone. He was an expense not worth keeping alive because he wasn't going to heal over time and, morally speaking, he would most likely choose death over living the current state he was in. We consented to the death of him. When we discuss specifically immoral acts, we don't use prejudice by including *all* acts of generalized actions, sometimes stealing something can be a moral, ethical, action... same with taking a life. When we discuss the dangers of pregnancy, it could escalate to even being a one life over the other scenario. If the child is unwanted, the risk is unwarranted. If the child is unwanted, the child could very well grow up and develop to being a negative part of society, especially if raised by parents that never wanted the child. Adoptions for babies, to my understanding, are fortunately really easy, but that doesn't cover other problems. Other problems include financial obligations which have varied support by health insurance, which don't compensate for the money lost from not working, it includes the great pain and inconvenience of having a child such as bone damage or back pain, there is permanent scars on the body (not just stretch marks! sometimes the babies might be too large for their exit requiring cutting), the financial stress of buying new clothing for the weight gain, the sacrifices taken as far as eating or consumption of goods just to keep the unwanted baby healthy, these are all sacrifices that are unfair for an individual that don't even want the child. Would you kill a hamster if it meant avoiding so many problems? If you were forced to kill a hamster if you wish to avoid all these problems, was it justified? Morally speaking, sometimes a small insignificant sacrifices is okay, that includes a non completed developing baby. Is it a life? Absolutely, but so are many animals we would comfortably kill that sometimes have an even greater personality than a fetus. When discussing morals, abortion truly is a matter of opinion but I cannot help but feel abortion being immoral isn't such a true statement considering the fetus has no identity, personality, or humanity yet."

"t1_dr4n01p"	"ArmadyleAster"	NA	"Okay, let's say, for the sake of it, that a fetus or zygote is a human being from as early as possible.Even then, it does not follow that abortion is immoral.Let's say that one day you wake up in a hospital bed with tubes connected to an injured person, and you're being told that he needs to borrow your kidneys and digestive system in order to survive.Would it be immoral to disconnect yourself and go home?No.You own your body and you can share it's resources woth another being only if you want.That's also why we don't kill a healthy person and harvest his or her organs, saving 5-10 other sick persons.A human being has the right to choose how and when his body is used.Okay, but where di we draw the line?Abortions in the 8th month sound pretty much like murder, right?Well, not really.If, for example, you do a c-section 2 weeks earlier, this counts as \\"choosing how your body is used\\", while keeping the baby alive.Actually, the earliest birth that survived was close to 22 weeks.At that point, we have proof that the baby can survive on it's own, as a regular person in emergency care, and we can safely apply the same standards to him as we would to any person, meaning killing is immoral.This is also where abortion becomes illegal in most countries, so i'd say most abortions in this world are not immoral."
"t1_dr4n0z4"	"cyantist"	NA	"This is called the fallacy of [equivocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation).In your (1) and (2) the term \\"human being\\" is used in two different ways. In (1) the term human being is being used to mean something like \\"a living being that is of the category of human development\\", while in (2) the term human being is being used to mean \\"a person\\".There's no doubt that a human zygote is a human-type zygote, and a zygote is a \\"being\\". But because it is not a human person the term \\"human being\\" is a technicality causing a slide into confusion. Both \\"All human beings are people\\" and \\"All people are human beings\\" are commonly agreeable statements until prompted to think critically about definitions and contexts.Therefore I challenge (1): there is every reason to believe that a qualified \\"human being\\" must be developed to a threshold of personhood. Those who believe \\"life begins at conception\\" are asserting specifically that personhood begins at conception. Due to miscarriage being quite common we often wait until after the first trimester to socially acknowledge a pregnancy as a viable potential upcoming person. Many will humanize recognized organs and traits of a fetus, while others assert that personhood is founded in birth generally. \\"Human being\\" cannot be said to be a clear binary with consensus — a zygote is not the same as a fetus, which is not the same as a baby, which is not the same as a child. You must discuss where the potential for a human person crosses over into personhood.Likewise I challenge (2): the assumption of immoral action in killing human beings is predicated on the status of personhood of the human being, and then generalized beyond what can be readily applied to anything said to be a \\"non-person human being\\". If we agree, \\"it is wrong to kill human beings\\", I am understanding that sentence to mean, \\"it is wrong to kill persons\\" and if that isn't what you mean when you say \\"human beings\\" then we are NOT in agreement.I hold that it is NOT immoral to kill a zygote if it is considered by its host to be unwanted, and this is a specific moral precept that has precedence over any generalized \\"it is immoral to kill\\". Euthanasia under proper circumstances is a moral act, not immoral. Specific moral determinations can and do take precedence over general ones, but as always the trick is to get past semantic or symbolic confusion and into actual moral content.Consider that freedom of speech is essential to a healthy democracy, a right unto itself with vital discourse being a moral good, but fraud or endangering speech is immoral. So too do the particulars of abortion and the arguments for determinations of personhood matter to the topic of abortion and its moral standing."
"t1_dr4nbon"	"Nibodhika"	"1"	"The thing is there's something called bodily autonomy, which in our society is valued more than human life. Consider this: you are in a hospital, you went there just for a regular check up, but while doing that they found out you're a perfect match to donate your kidney to a 5 yo who's dying. No one is denying you that the 5 yo is alive, or that killing is wrong, yet you have the choice of not donating your kidney, it would be considered imoral by most people if you were forced to donation, because we put your own bodily integrity above the life of another person. Yet not donating implies in the child's death.Following the same line of thought the Mother bodily autonomy is put in jeopardy by the fetus, so she can have it removed without it being imoral. Forcing a woman to proceed with an unwanted pregnancy is equivalent to forcing someone to donate an organ, even if there's another life at stake our society feels there's a more valuable thing in jeopardy."

"t1_dr4oce1"	"zeek0"	NA	"I'll target this part: \\"It is immoral to kill human beings.\\"You are looking at this as though this is a natural rule (deontology). While some people operate their ethics in this way, many are consequentialists - they look entirely at the consequences of the actions, and place no natural value on the action itself.For example, consider a situation where you kill a person in self defense. A deontologist would say that you did a bad thing, but perhaps there are greater rules that allowed you to kill that person. A consequentialist would only look at the results, see the results are good, and conclude that you did a good thing.So we look at the consequences of abortion. A society with greater access to abortion means that women have fewer children, and they have children in more stable family and life situations. This greatly increases a variety of qualities about children - from intelligence to mental health.You talk a lot about the way that society tends to refers to/thinks about things, or your gut reaction. Many don't think that these are good arbiters of ethical decisions, and that there's better ways to make decisions (a set of rules to follow, or considering the consequences directly)."

In order for the taking of life to have moral weight someone has to feel the impact of that.

"t1_dr4pmal"	"Anzai"	NA	"I’d disagree with both of your points.For number 1, a collection of human cells are absolutely not the same thing a species a human being. If that were the case, a large amount of of excreta would be considered a human being as well. When a woman has her period, that would be considered a human being as well. It has the potential to be human, but that doesn’t make it human. A fertilised ovum is not substantially different from an unfertilised one, which women expel monthly.For number 2. Although I don’t believe it’s particularly relevant to this debate, it is not always an immoral act to kill a human being. To kill in self defence, or in the defence of others is not considered immoral. For a soldier to kill another soldier in time of war is not always considered immoral although depending on circumstances it can be. For a doctor to prioritise the mothers life over the babies life when only one can be saved is not immoral, nor is euthanasia which is legal in many places. In fact in the case of the latter, some consider it immoral to deny euthanasia to people who are suffering. I mention this only because you stated it as an absolute ‘killing is immoral’ whereas most people would take a far more nuanced approach to when it is or isn’t immoral, and that includes abortion even if they did believe a freshly fertilised ovum was a human being, which most people do not.The semantics of people referring to a zygote as ‘the baby’ is dependent on whether they are the parents and are planning on keeping it. A scientist in a lab extracting stem cells certainly doesn’t refer to it as ‘the baby’. People say that based on intention and anticipation, and it is irrelevant as evidence of personhood.Your last two paragraphs seem to imply you don’t understand how and when abortions are actually performed. Late term abortions are rare and are usually carried out for health reasons and are a traumatic event. Women who abort their pregnancy simply because they don’t wish to have a child are not doing it ‘a few days before’. Generally it’s in the first nine weeks or so.There’s a reason for this, even if it’s a fuzzy line. You state that ‘the instant it’s born it has as much moral value as any other person’, but it is usually bestowed those rights sometime before birth, hence why abortions have a cut off date that is well before birth.You seem to like absolutes. Anything with human cells is a human being. Killing is always wrong. A zygote has NO moral value. You can’t simply view everything as an either or. Reality is much messier than that, and definitions are man made and imperfect. There is a grey area on literally everything. Look up how we define what a species is and see how fuzzy the concept actually is, then try and decide what is and isn’t a human. It’s not going to be a sharp line, and conception and birth are possibly the least useful markers."
"t1_dr4ps14"	"nsadonvisadjco"	NA	"It's not moral to let someone experience agony without their consent, even if there's also bliss somewhere in the experience.Similarly, it's not moral to give birth to someone without their consent, as life involves agony; and the unborn can't consent."
"t1_dr4qy5m"	"Durzio"	NA	"I think this philosophy is inherently useless and unhelpful. There is no way to ask a person who doesn’t yet exist to consent to being born, so there is no solution. Your argument also implies that if someone experiences bliss for 99% of their life, just 1% agony makes the entire thing an immoral act by the mother, because of the presence of agony even with bliss in the experience. I would argue instead that it is morally neutral to give birth."
"t1_dr5diqz"	"nsadonvisadjco"	NA	"In absolutist terms, it's more of a philosophical argument than a practically useful argument.In a more nuanced form, you could argue that giving birth used to be moral, but now the world is so screwed up that it's not moral anymore - at least for parents in certain situations.

"t1_dr4q5in"	"MrXian"	"2"	"I wouldn't call a fetus - especially early on in it's development - a human being. At best it is a potential human being. Most abortions are performed early enough that the fetus has no chance at all of surviving on it's own. It cannot see, think, reason or do anything at all. Visually, most people can't distinguish it from a similarly aged fetus of another mammal. It barely qualifies as a being, and it passes no test other than parentage of being a human.Secondly, you have to consider why the abortion takes place, and what the results would be if the baby is born and raised.First of all, pregnancy is not without risk. There are health risks, as pregnancy can lead to serious complications or death.There are economic risks, as having a baby in a hospital can leave a person in crippling debt.There are social risks, as you cannot continue your life as normal during or after the pregnancy.There are career risks, as you cannot work normally or go to school normally when pregnant or when you have a baby.And those are only the risks to the mother. Plenty of abortions are done because the mother cannot properly care for the child, leading the child to potentially end up in foster care, being badly educated or becoming a criminal.All in all, having an abortion or not is an extremely hard decision to make. Calling it an immoral act helps no-one in this discussion.Lastly, I would debate that killing a fellow human is not an immoral act. There are plenty of killings that are morally completely defendable.tl;dr - A fetus isn't really a human being, and killing isn't always immoral. Apart from that the language used does not further the discussion, so it should be avoided."

"t1_dr4qj8m"	"Durzio"	NA	"Firstly, I would like to get this out there, For me, being pro choice isn’t about the zygote/fetus. it’s about protecting the right to Bodily Autonomy. You have the right to decide what happens to your body, period. Doctors need consent for nearly everything. Even corpses maintain this right. Fictional Example: I have a blood disease and need a donation to live, you are the only match in the entire world. Even though taking blood is a harmless routine procedure (1), and even though you are the only person that can save my life (2), the government cannot force you to donate blood to me. What this demonstrates is that 1.) bodily autonomy is maintained regardless of risk. If something is non-risky, it cannot be forced into you, so logically it would make even less sense to force something on you if it *is* risky.And2.) no one can force you to do something, *even if another life is at risk*.Therefore given that pregnancy does come with risks and even if you count an as of yet unformed zygote as a person there is no legal basis for denying abortion based on the principle of Bodily Autonomy. Secondly, to address your question of morals, I disagree with the idea that a clump of cells that can not communicate or even form thoughts of any kind is a person. This is most simply demonstrated in the following thought process: If you bury a seed in the ground, than dig it up, you did not just cut down a tree. It’s not any more immoral to have an abortion than it is to clip your toenails or cut your hair. You are removing cells from your body, and you have the final say over your body. Now, I can understand the other side as well, but the *potential* for human life is not the same as human life. If that were the case, and this is obviously a hyperbolic example but, masturbation to completion could be almost like mass murder couldn’t it? You’re removing all those cells with potential from their safe environment and abandoning them somewhere to die. Yes I know they don’t technically have potential without an egg, but they also could have conceivably (no pun intended) reached an egg if you didn’t ejaculate them away to their “deaths”. And thirdly, just to play devils advocate, while I don’t believe that zygotes/fetuses are equivalent to human life, are you saying you think it’s *never* a moral choice to kill a human being?"
"t1_dr4qke8"	"ThiccAsTheDevil"	NA	"There are probably people more qualified to discuss this topic than I am. Please note thatI may get several things wrong.The main thing that I take issue with you saying is that a zygote/embryo/fetus is a human being, as most people here are saying. A zygote is not a human being. An embryo, similarly, is not. A fetus is more debateable.A zygote/an embryo is a bundle of cells. You know what else is a bundle of cells? Your finger. No ‘you’ attached, just your finger. If we were to ‘clone’ your finger (yes I know that’s not how cloning works) and ‘kill’ it, so that none of the cells within it were alive, would it be immoral? I’d think not. If we were to clone you, however, and then kill the clone, it would be.There are reasons that there are limits to how far into your pregnancy you can abort. At some point it stops being a bundle of cells, but when exactly is that? The line’s fuzzy. Right before you give birth, it’s already a human. When a zygote... not really. In between, there are points at which we don’t know.If a woman waits 8 months, knowing fully well she is pregnant, under no special circumstances, to abort, I’d say it could be considered immoral. If a woman aborts a zygote/embryo/fetus in its early stages, I’d say she’s done nothing more than kill a bundle of cells. Just because it has the potential to be a human, does not make it a human. If that were true, condoms would be mass murderers."

"t1_dr4r6yu"	"kavihasya"	NA	"Morality often considers the allocation of scarce resources. In the case of abortion, the scarce resource involved is use of the woman’s body. The woman has only one and it is hers. The fetus can only grow in one, and it does not belong to the fetus. Therefore, think about cases where there exists a “legitimate” (you define) need for a woman to have jurisdiction over her body and the resources it can create. An example might be a single mom whose existing children will become homeless if she loses her job due to pregnancy (still happens and more than half of women who have abortions are already mothers). Such a woman may considered herself to have a moral responsibility to use her body to care for existing children rather than using it to create more. As a moral actor who needs to live with the outcome of her choice, whatever it is, she must be the one to weigh these needs against each other. Another example may be a woman who takes psychotropic medications to maintain her mental health that she cannot take while pregnant. She will not get a “pass” for behavior while (preventably) mentally ill. She will need to live with destruction of her relationships, etc should it ensue. Focus on the impact of the pregnancy itself instead of just imagining that it is a smooth path to a guaranteed healthy baby. Remember that simply being a pregnant woman is more likely to result in death than being a cop or a firefighter. Remember also that an ill-timed pregnancy can seriously disrupt a woman’s future. Does she finish high school? medical school? Is this the event that leaves her financially dependent on an abusive relationship?Women need their bodies. Women need the resources that their bodies can create both in their day to day lives and for their own safe secure futures. It is not immoral to choose to use your own body in a way that fits your needs and responsibilities as you understand them. It’s more that the reverse is also true: Giving birth is a profoundly generous gift of that body/those resources. A gift that no one is entitled to and yet everyone living has received. Aren’t mothers amazing?"

"t1_dr4rh85"	"DashingLeech"	"28"	"The problems I see with your arguments, and which I see commonly, is something akin to \\"labelism\\". That is, if you can somehow label two things into the same category, all rules governing one must govern the other as well.At best labeling can address issues of *kind*. It doesn't address issues of *degree*. Even that is a bit oversimplifying, as the whole point in \\"kind\\" and \\"degree\\" is looking for ways to simplify rules by analogy to rules we accept for other things. But, just simplifying is a helpful tool for communication; we still must be able to argue the rule for every single case *on its own merits*.Whether you call a zygote or fetus a human being or not is irrelevant to the argument. That's misdirection. The reason we say it is immoral to kill human beings has built into the argument an assumption about that human being, and those assumption may not apply to a zygote or fetus. Simply categorizing them together and transferring the rule results in scope creep for the rule.So let's start from the base morality. Killing other living tissues is not, itself, immoral. It is necessary for any living being to kill another living being for food, or at least live off of its death, whether plant or animal. We destroy plenty of our own living cells on a daily basis. That is just part of life.As far as intentional killing, there are sociological reasons for avoiding killing other humans. We used to do it all the time in tribes, and many still do and see it as moral. Chimpanzees regularly kill stray chimps from other tribes as well. It's makes perfect sense from the mathematics of competition for survival and reproduction with limited resources of food and territory.The math is fairly straightforward that with limited resources, some people will have to go, but since 2 people can beat 1 person, etc., that grouping up with others to ensure members of *your* group aren't the ones that go increases your chances of survival, which results in the others doing the same, hence ingroup/outgroup tribes, and the warring ends up solving the problem of killing off enough for the available resources and/or starvation and suffering. As part of that, we evolved ingroup morality for not killing members of our own group for similar reasons. To get the protection of the group, you need to have each other's back. Traitors in the midst ruins the value so everybody in the group would be best to kill off any traitors. But that sets up the dichotomy: don't kill your ingroup unless they *deserve* by putting you in danger.As we became more civilized we've learned how to deal with even intergroup issues more effectively, and the costs of fighting against each other vs the benefits of agreements of peace and helping each other with problems of resources instead of fighting over them. It effectively grows the ingroup to a larger scale as we are able to accommodate it, thanks to growing economies of plenty, technologies, farming, housing, etc.So that morality largely grows out of the instinctual value of other *adult* humans, including reciprocal costs and benefits. If you are free to kill other people and their families, then they are free to kill you and yours. Having a common social agreement to not do that provides value to everybody. That value is what we call a moral. And it does include children at this point, both other people's children -- because if you could kill theirs then they could kill yours -- and you want your own children alive instinctually as that is the basis of reproductive success. Our love and care for our children is built into the instincts of all animals as a natural drive for reproductive success. Those that don't have that drive don't pass on their genes; those that do are the ones with descendants alive today, hence the evolution of genes for caring about our children.Part of the evolution of this morality toward outgroup people to include them into a larger ingroup is via empathy; we can *understand* what it is like to be them and to live in fear of being killed, or having our family killed, or friends, or others in our community. We can understand each other and come to an agreement that it is wrong to kill each other *unless justified* by some danger or risk, such as criminal actions that show they are a threat to us and don't live by the same social rules. Then we can't trust them.That empathy provides us a new hook for our morality hat. We can empathize with *creatures that suffer*, and we can agree that it's not fair to kill anything in a way that causes it to suffer, or takes its life *unnecessarily*. That is, it is ok to kill for food (humanely), and in self-defense or to protect people, but we agree that we won't even kill animals needlessly. (That part isn't reciprocal, of course, but driven by empathy and as signals to each other about our own empathy, signaling that we are not a threat.)That is the general basis for the respect for life. But our empathy is based on the *complexity* of the other being. We don't have a problem killing bugs, for example, or single-celled organisms, or rats, or other pests. Our scale of empathy and the degree of \\"unnecessary\\" depends on the complexity of the animal, how much in can suffer, how cognitive it is. A simple life form lacks those things, so we don't have have a problem ending its life, even unnecessarily. As you get more complex and more cognitive beings, the more immoral it is to kill them unnecessarily.Applied to a human zygote, a few cells have no right to life. We can't have empathy for a few cells. It doesn't think. It can't suffer. It is not aware of itself. It really doesn't have the ability to care.On the flip side, we *can* have empathy for the mother that is carrying it. That zygote can be a negative cost on her life. Arguably, we can empathize with the negative life of the future baby as well *if it were allowed to grow into a baby and child*. If it isn't allowed to grow that far, there is no future baby or child to empathize with.Taken together, we can conclude that a zygote does not have sufficient complexity to warrant empathy or consideration, and the mother's interests over her own life and body easily win the cost-benefit value in terms of what is the moral value. When the fetus is 5 minutes away from birth, it is complex enough to be able to suffer, feel pain, experience its surroundings, and have some self-awareness. The cost to the mother at this point is also negligible as it is 5 minutes of effort. Taken together, the balance is clearly now in favour of the fetus. (An exception would be if the birth will kill one of them. Then we have to choose which, and killing the baby would likely make more sense, particularly if the mother has other children and a family.)So somewhere between a zygote and birth is a point where the interests of the fetus exceed the interests of the mother in terms of empathy, value, and morality. That timing can be a big \\"fuzzy\\" zone, but based on the above morality analysis it will generally be sometime around when it can first feel pain, suffer, have some awareness, and perhaps survive on its own if extracted from the mother. We don't need to go into each degree of those as the result will still be fuzzy.However, what we do know from science is that this timeline will generally be around weeks 20 - 25 of the pregnancy. One could argue one way or the other for a little earlier or later, and certainly with complications to the pregnancy, we can move that cost-benefit calculation later for a \\"late term abortion\\" when life-threatening to the mother or the baby has been damaged enough already that is isn't viable, but still going through motions of pregnancy.That's why most places that allow abortions have a cutoff somewhere around week 23-24. Prior to that it is generally clear that the fetus isn't sufficiently complex to warrant our empathy, and the effort of the mother to carry it to term are much longer, and we can empathize more with her interests than the early-stage fetus. In that case, we can judge it as being moral.After that fuzzy zone, as birth gets closer, the fetus is more complex and the required effort of the mother diminishes, so the cost-benefit value/morality can reverse. It's a little fuzzy in the middle, but fuzzy moral conditions are common, such as the [trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem).So, I think it is reasonable to conclude that before about week 20 it is clearly moral to have an abortion. After about week 25 it is arguably immoral without complicating factors to the mother or fetus making it necessary. in between around week 23 is the threshold where the morality is best likely to shift.It is much like addressing a \\"safe\\" speed. It's not like 1 mph below the speed limit is safe and 1 mph over the speed limit is unsafe. They are virtually the same speed. But, we need a threshold to address a large fuzzy region below which is clearly safe and above which is clearly dangerous. The same is true of abortion and morality.So I don't particularly care what label you attach to any of this. The labels and words are irrelevant. What matters are the concepts of what a moral is and where it comes from, and how that applies to pregnancy, including both fetus and mother, and how we address conflicting interests specifically applied to the case of pregnancy.Shortcut analogies and labels just don't provide any value to me in these arguments, and I don't see how they help.

If everyone's opinion on this changed over night, would that change the nature of the act itself?As such it's an easily dismissed claim, not because it's not true, but because it's irrelevant.Certainly, there are moral reasons to kill people. We base our entire judiciary on the idea that there's a difference between murder, manslaughter, self defense, and economics. We base our police and military on the idea that some violence is moral and thus state sanctioned. And then there's point number one: a fetus isn't fully a person so long as it cannot exist outside or independent of its mother. Indeed, it would be a curtailing of the mother's bodily autonomy to prioritize a human part of herself over her actual personhood, no? Something akin to valuing her nose over her face, or a tumorous growth over the healthy organ. You'll have to prove why killing is immoral before you can prove why killing nonpersons is immoral."

To put a magic number that says, human one day, not human the next is ridiculous. There are two mental exercises, one is if a woman who is overdue to deliver finds her husband is cheating and decides to \\"kill his baby\\", should it be allowed to abort/kill a full term baby because the mother is pissed at the dad? The other question is what right do we have telling a pregnant woman what she can or can't do while pregnant? Go out and do drugs that will cause a deformity? Her body, her right? When she dumps the deformed and retarded baby at the firehouse, we just have to find it a good home, right?That being said, there are often times when we must decide on the lesser immoral choice, or the side of greater morality. Just killing the embryo or fetus before it becomes self aware may be a higher moral choice then raising it to self awareness and then neglecting, abusing or raising to be a detriment to society. Some people just cannot be good parents, and maybe killing the baby before it does any harm is the best immoral choice. Now, if the decisions are immoral and even more immoral, maybe in some jacked up way that makes the immoral a moral choice. Trapped in the wilderness, no hope of rescue and someone is dying a painful death and wants to die, killing them may be immoral, but doing nothing is more immoral. Since we do not have the ability to choose our situation, then the immoral becomes moral just because of the lack of options and that we are forced in a situation. Applied to pregnancy, it may be a bit much to say a pregnant woman didnt choose, but mistakes happen, birth control fails, and stupidity is out there."

The Old Testament of the Bible mentions only that a formed fetus, or one with the shape and features of a human baby, would warrant full legal protection in the “life for a life” sense, as referenced in Exodus. British common law (upon which much of US law is based) only outlawed abortion after the quickening. The idea that a zygote is a human is a *very* modern idea, and a harmful one. This adds emotional pain to miscarriages (20-50(!)% of all pregnancies end in miscarriage).

There are many situations in which killing a human being is not immoral, like, for example, abortions. If this sounds like circular reasoning, it's because it is.You have to actually examine your moral absolute that you laid out: it is immoral to kill human beings. Is it really? Why? What about in a war situation? If a human being comes at you with a bomb, is it immoral to kill him before he blows you up? What about the human being who murdered your wife in cold blood; is it immoral to kill him after due process? You could argue that these human beings are not \\"innocent\\", whatever that means, and that the zygote/fertilized egg/embryo/bundle of cells/whatever hasn't done anything wrong. OK... so? Why is innocence relevant for a bundle of cells? It's important for us sentient humans to feel safe in society, so we've established moral guidelines for when it's OK to kill us. If we aren't doing something bad, we generally expect not to be killed for it, and for our killers to be punished by the law if anyone does kill us. But zygotes don't have that expectation. Or brains; they don't have those either. Why should our moral guidelines about safety in society apply to them? They don't know and don't care about society!Ultimately, if you get an abortion and don't tell anyone, nobody will complain. Nobody will care. There won't be any victims. There won't be anyone wronged. Therefore, intrinsically, nothing immoral was done. Immorality only comes from your relationships with other people. Here's where you may bring up cheating on an exam: what if nobody finds out you cheated? Then you're OK. But if someone *does* find out, well, you implicitly agreed not to cheat when you went to school, so that person that finds out can now consider you untrustworthy for your immoral act. On the other hand, there is no implicit agreement regarding control of your own body when it comes to abortion. The only possible victims are those who were emotionally invested in the parasite you removed. If nobody was invested in it, there are *literally* no possible victims, and if people were, then it's too bad for them because your body autonomy trumps their desires. Pretty simple, really!"

"t1_dr4vupj"	"TheFeshy"	NA	"Arguing by category (\no reason to believe it isn't human/it's wrong to kill humans\\") should *always* raise a red flag. Let me give you a (hopefully) less controversial example to highlight why it should:1. Martin Luther King Jr is a celebrated civil rights activist2. MLK was a criminal3. Everyone agrees we generally shouldn't celebrate criminals4. Therefore MLK should *not* be a celebrated civil rights activist.Of course, the flawed reasoning in this example shows up pretty easily if we examine it more closely. We don't *generally* celebrate criminals, but why? Because their actions are harmful to individuals and/or society. What about the laws broken by MLK? Well, we generally feel those *laws* were harmful to individuals and society, and he was right to protest them and break them. In fact, that's exactly what he is celebrated for doing.So our usual reasons for being dismissive of the category \criminals\\" do not apply in this specific case, even though MLK is in that category.The same thing applies to \humans\\" in your reasoning. Rather than lump fetuses in the category \humans\\" and do our reasoning based on what might be a poor categorization, back it up a step like we did with MLK. Ask yourself these two questions:1. What about human life is worth preserving?2. Does a fetus have whatever your answer to #1 is?I'm not saying there is only one right answer to this, especially #1. What I *am* saying is that it's perfectly possible that your answer to #2 is \no.\\" Which means that, even though killing humans is (in general) morally wrong, killing fetuses isn't. Just as in the general case, celebrating criminals is wrong, but celebrating MLK's contributions is not.Edit for thoroughness: there are answers, based on this idea, that I find to be good resolutions for your other complaints too:* It is quite possible that your answer to my question #2 above is \no\\" for unwanted fetuses, but \yes\\" for wanted ones. If this is the case, it doesn't seem weird at all to be more outraged about the death of a pregnant woman than a non-pregnant woman. There are probably other subdivisions of that question too, such as:* People being appalled if late-stage abortion for convenience were common. It is quite possible your answer to #2 above is different for early/late stage development. * Sudden immorality at birth: It is *also* possible that this isn't a hard and fast division, and that there is a sliding scale, where your answer to #1 contains many elements that are worth preserving, and fetuses continue to gain them as they develop.Lastly, and somewhat unrelated:* Calling it a fetus or a baby: If your neighbor is building a boat in his garage, you would ask him how the boat is coming along - even if \How is the pile of lumber in your garage?\\" is more accurate. Likewise, if he does have a pile of lumber in his garage he is trying to get rid of, it would be weird to ask about his \boat.\\"

"t1_dr4wscf"	"Zcuron"	NA	"&gt; A zygote/fetus is a human being --&gt; It is immoral to kill human beings --&gt; Thus an abortion is immoral| 1. No. There's more to 'human being' than what is meant there. What we value lies in that 'more' part. | 2. No. It's not inherently immoral to kill human beings. (see: defence, euthanasia) | 3. As both premises are false, this does not follow.; 1) There is plenty of reason to suggest that a zygote/fetus is not a person, but there is no reason to believe that it isn't a human beingIrrelevant. The category of 'human being' isn't inherently the reason for which we give it moral consideration. Take animals for example - they're not human. Yet, most are repulsed by the idea of animal torture. At the most basic level; | 1. We don't like suffering - suffering is 'bad'. (selfish) | 2. We see others like us. (extend 'self' to others) | 3. Therefore, if our suffering is bad, theirs is too.How wide you cast your net with #2 determines what you'll offer moral consideration to. Some don't extend it to animals. Some also re-classify select humans *as* animals. My point with this is as follows; | 1. What we consider 'suffering' has *something* to do with being alive. ('rocks' don't suffer) | 2. It has *something* to do with having a nervous system. ('plants' don't suffer) | 3. It has *something* to do with the complexity of #2. (do 'flies' suffer?)A zygote is a singular 'human' cell; an egg fertilised by sperm. It does not have a nervous system. It cannot suffer. Ergo, it has no moral worth of this kind. It also cannot think, therefore it's not a person. Ergo, it has no moral worth of this kind, either. The line at which one considers it 'sufficiently complex' is fuzzy, but it certainly isn't *here*.People often bring up 'potential', but I find that argument a non-starter; We are currently able to fuck, thereby creating more of this 'potential'. Observe your surroundings - There exist capable women who are currently not pregnant, nor being impregnated. Clearly this 'potential' has relatively low moral worth, enough for it to be a two-ish times in a lifetime event.Compared to, say, suffering. Which we move to prevent or reduce in every interaction, every day, our entire lives. And when we consider this subject, there's no particular difference between the elimination of created 'potential' (zygote) and not creating this 'potential' in the first place. Both result in this 'potential' not existing.Instead we see a slow increase of this 'potential's' worth as the zygote becomes baby. Well, why is it increasing? I submit that the answer to that question, is what we really value. Not this nebulous 'potential'.==; 2) Even among pro-choice advocates, most probably would agree that it is immoral to kill human beingsWhat 'most agree upon' is irrelevant. And it's not *inherently* immoral to kill human beings. Whether it is a moral or immoral act depends on what circumstances surround the act.It's fine if; If the human being requests to be killed. (though some conditions can make the request itself dubious) If the human being can only be prevented from 'not:fine-killing' someone by ending their life. &lt;your imagination goes here&gt; (come on; give it a spin!) ==; We refer to the zygote/fetus as \\"the child\\", \\"the baby\\", etc... Not \\"it\\" or \\"the zygote\\" or \\"the thing\\".Irrelevant. Language has no *prescriptive* power over reality. It can merely describe; and descriptions can be wrong. Humans are objects, too. They tend to dislike being called such as they consider it an insufficient description. Humans like their person-hood. As they should. That's where most of the fun stuff is, anyway.Zygotes, notably, do not have 'person-hood', as they lack the capacity; the ability to do, think, speak, move, or in any way betray any manner of quality we'd expect from a 'human being'. This comes later, with time and care. ; A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).Law also reflects societal values, especially moral ones. (which doesn't mean laws are necessarily moral) As an aside, those stories can certainly be emotive, but they can also be stupendously dumb. Clearly, as long as she can bear more children, the intelligent thing to do in all cases is to save the mother. I'll also note how this choice, as it results in the death of one or the other, involves killing a human being.; Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth. Not saying this is what happens, just that most in our society wouldn't be comfortable with this.Indeed. Like I said before on the subject of fuzzy lines; The line certainly isn't *here* either.; It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.Presumably you'd argue this point wherever the line *is* drawn. (i.e. even if not at birth) You're right, though I think the premise of lines is malformed. It's not that moral value is a yes/no question, but instead that moral value steadily increases with time. From nothing at conception, to certainly something at birth, to perhaps a little more as the idiot grows an identity. Then in old age, moral value clearly declines as well, reflected by how we value the young over the old in general.We also value human beings over animals in general. I.e. there's a difference in value there as well. And whenever we do consider the question 'which ought to live, if you had to choose' - that's a moral evaluation. A consideration of the worth of a person, compared to another. We have the ability. We just don't like using it."

But not for quite the same reasons as you.It doesn't matter whether a zygote is made of human cells or not or whether we consider it human, what matters is consciousness/sentience. It is morally wrong to kill a conscious/sentient being. The thing is, it's near impossible to tell when a zygote/baby becomes sentient/conscious and we certainly don't have the means to even strictly classify those terms right now let alone determine a cutoff point of 'conscious enough' because it's fairly clear that it's not a binary thing but rather a sliding scale.So we are left with instead a reliance on potential instead of actuality. Because a zygote has the potential to become a person is it therefore wrong to take that potential away before it is realized? If that person does not exist yet then who are you taking that potential away from if you do so? The entire question of where to draw the line is morally ambiguous at best and would be better applied on a case by case basis(ethically not logistically speaking) and would require both the technology to measure sentience and the understanding to determine an actual cutoff neither of which we have yet."

"t1_dr5gx9d"	"TheRationalDove"	NA	"Because these discussions don't ever include facts about embryonic development, here are some things you should know about fetal development in humans:-The actual moment of conception doesn't occur immediately after ejaculation, but rather a couple days later. This is because sperm needs to be \\"capacitated\\" in order for them to be able to fertilize the egg. Bascially, sperm in their natural state have to undergo some biochemical changes in order to fertilize the egg. They actually attach themselves to the oviduct walls when this happens. In other words, if you tossed some fresh ejaculate into a Petri dish with an egg cell, no fertilization would happen unless you treated the sperm with special buffers first. This is why anyone who tells you the Plan B pill is an abortion method is lying to you. It prevents fertilization within that two day capacitation window. Plan B does not work once fertilization occurs.-Some of the cells that are created during the early stages of fertilization go to creating the embryo side of the placenta. At that early stage, it is even possible for you to remove a cell or two and not affect the development of the fetus because cell fate is so plastic. -For the few weeks into development, the embryo can split at any point and create identical twins until after a critical point during gastrulation.-Every cell in your body has your full genome in it. Skin cells have genes in them for eye color, for example. Therefore, every cell in your body is technically capable of becoming a clone of you as it has genes that allow embryonic development to happen. The only reason why your skin cells don't start secreting stomach acids is because the genes that are irrelevant for proper function are turned off.My point in listing all of this is that I know many religious groups try to use science to explain why abortion is immoral. I remember how there would be presentation in my Catholic Sunday school showing fetal development. But it seems a bit fishy that they would not mention these aspects of development. For one, if your religion believes that a single celled zygote should be considered an individual, then how can they explain indentical twins? Souls are said to be unbreakable, so they can't spilt into two when indentical twins are created. Are the egg cells that become identical twins given two souls? If we define humanity by its genome, then every cell in the body must also be human, too. If we define humanity by its physical shape, then do we consider cells that eventually become placenta human, too? How we define humanity is more defined my social values than anything scientific.

"t1_dr4kujv"	"jaimedieuetilmaime"	NA	"Fascinating! I’d read that passage many times before, but hadn’t considered it could be about an abortion—the only translation that even suggests abortion is the 2011 NIV. After some quick research, it seems the passage is ambiguous in its wording. Contemporary sources to the time of the temple seem to say the “bitter water” was holy water used in the temple rites mixed with soil from the temple floor (which would not cause an abortion), however. It seems like the standard position from scholars today is that it was a test for wives whose husbands had reason to suspect infidelity that required direct intervention from God to work. If the woman was unfaithful, God would know and would cause her to sicken in some way (some people postulate her stomach would bloat or wizen, or her uterus would prolapse, or she would turn pale and ill, or her thigh/ stomach would wizen.... the wording here is ambiguous at best). If she had remained faithful, her husband could have ease of mind. What with the other passages in the Bible about how God knows, crafts, and loves children in the womb, I would say it is an incorrect interpretation of the passage to suggest it was a forced or accepted abortion even at the time (considering the rest of the Bible as a hermeneutic). If you’d like to explore why I believe this is the correct interpretation:[Here’s the verse in Hebrew](http://biblehub.com/interlinear/numbers/5-27.htm) [Here are some well-accepted commentaries](http://biblehub.com/commentaries/numbers/5-27.htm) [And here’s a quick article written by some pastors](https://www.gotquestions.org/Numbers-abortion.html) Thanks so much for the input—I always enjoy exploring topics like this more!"

I disagree that it wouldn't have a high likelyhood of of causing a miscarriage/abortion. Contracting food poisoning, such as listeria and e coli, is basically an automatic miscarriage in the first trimester. Sure a random soil sample from outside might not get you sick, but we are talking about a temple floor of an ancient *agrarian* society. Everyone who comes through there has feet covered in feces.

Take this thought experiment: Say you’ve got a building on fire. In one room, you have a test tube zygote. In another room you have a five year old. You only have time to go to one room - do you save the zygote or the five year old? Even the staunchest pro-life people would likely say the five year old. So already we’ve put a value on life. Then how about this. One of the rooms has a bag with five test tube zygotes, the other still has the one five year old. Most people I know would still pick the five year old over five zygotes. Now say we’ve got the technology to entire incubate a fetus in a lab. In one room you have a 32 week old fetus - could probably survive outside the incubator. Do you save it over the five year old? What if it’s five 32 week fetuses. Again, I would say most people would say no. There is an inherent value to being alive that a fetus, though it has the potential for life, doesn’t have.

"t1_dr4fyh2"	"RickRussellTX"	"5"	"In your moral fable, both the child and the zygotes (or fetuses) are in imminent peril. We must trade one for the other.But such is not the case with abortion. Asking a woman (and presumably the man who fathered the child as well) to give up some resources so that 9 months can pass is not going to result in a 5 year old ending up dead. With rare exceptions, it won't result in any long-term discomfort or health issues for the mother and father. Of course those rare exceptions are important; maternal death is currently running about 3/10000 in the US. How do we reckon the life of the fetus against (some resources + 3/10000 chance death + chance of some additional complications)?I don't have a good answer to that, but a simple scale of justice with a zygote on one plate and a 5-year-old on the other is not really instructive."
"t1_dr4gut8"	"NowTimeDothWasteMe"	"6"	"Copied from my comment above with minor edits:The vast majority (&gt;70%) of women who have abortions in the US have at least one other child and the most common reason for having an abortion is because pregnancy/a new child would put stress (financial and other) on the already existing family unit. So when the choice becomes - I have to kill this fetus or not have enough money to feed my 5 year old or pay for rent for my 5 year old or have time to help my 5 year old with their homework so they can be educated and escape this cycle of poverty - there is a very different moral obligation. And people talk about adoption, but prenatal care itself can cost anywhere from $9,000-250,000 and it’s very hard to know what end of that because predicting who’s going to have a complicated course is very difficult. If you are already struggling, that can make a huge difference. No one is going to argue that abortion is a unilaterally moral action. But when we consider some of the trade offs I don’t think that one can argue that it’s an inherently immoral action either Edit - also complications after pregnancy persisting for at least six months after delivery are reported by about a third of women. It’s not all that rare to experience long lasting health effects"
"t1_dr4hmht"	"RickRussellTX"	"5"	"&gt; when the choice becomes - I have to kill this fetus or not have enough money to feed... complications after pregnancyI will readily admit that there are situations where that is the case. I'm not implying that depriving the mother of resources and putting her life at risk is a *trivial* matter, and if I gave that impression I apologize. But it's nowhere near the moral equivalent of *leaving a child to die in a fire*. That's why the example is not instructive.; prenatal care itself can cost anywhereCertainly. And if I were to endorse this position as a matter of public policy (which I am not, yet!), I would also want socialized medicine and some plan to deal with the unwanted children."

"t1_dr4jxqz"	"Ikorodude"	NA	"So if it's your child, or a random child, does your child have more value because you would save them? How many random children do you think parents would trade for their own? Is that how many their child is worth? Hell, let's have 10 random children behind a soundproof door, and 2 behind a glass one, that can see and hear you and vice versa. I think most people would be unable to look children in the eye while saving the larger group, and so would save the two children. Do they have more value than the ten for this reason?"
"t1_dr4qekr"	"Aim_2_misbehave"	NA	"Your argument shows a pretty fundamental error in understanding how an unwanted pregnancy affects the life of the woman forced to carry it. For starters \\"some resources\\" is a gross understatement of what must be committed to bring a healthy child to term, and ensuring that it continues post birth to life a happy, healthy life. The cost of pre-natal vitamins and checkups is more than a lot of people can afford, especially since unplanned pregnancy disproportionately affect lower economic brackets and women of color, due to lack of resources in those communities for family planning, birth control and sex education. The \\"resources\\" required may well be more than she has to sacrifice. And that's just the direct economic impact, and doesn't account for the fact that she'll probably have to drop out of school, or sacrifice her prospect of higher education to pay for pre-natal care. What if she has complications during the pregnancy that drive her costs up even higher, or put her health at risk, or risk her future reproductive prospects; are these also sacrifices she mustake? Is the prospect of the life of the fetus really worth the prospect of her future. The other problem with your expectation of \\"sacrifice\\" is that it have an equal effect on both parents, or will be equal across society. The fact of the matter is that it doesn't affect the male parent nearly to the degree to which it affects the life of the female parent. All those secondary costs I listed above apply only to the person who's body is carrying the child. At most, he is potentially affected by the cost of pre-natal care, and even that is often placed solely on the woman, should the man who impregnated her refuse to take responsibility.Women, and moreover economically disadvantaged women and minority women are particularly at risk from the burden of an unwanted pregnancy. These are already disadvantaged classes in our society, and the problem of abortion and unplanned parenthood is one that must be tackled at a societal level. No one who is pro-choice, thinks that abortion is great, or should be treated frivolously, but to pretend that it's only the life of the fetus at stake is criminally short sighted. Until we as a society can ensure that all members of society have equal access to contraception, sex-education, and pre- *and* post-natal assistance, then abortion continues to be the *most* moral choice in a lot of unplanned pregnancies."

Some say life is priceless so 5 lives is not worth more than 1, they would be equal. In which case 1 zygote is *equal* to 5 five year-olds. You can't measure the importance of a life so there is no right or wrong answer here and it should not be argued.Additionally, think about the statistics. It's much more likely that **one** 5 yo dies within, say, the next 5 years than all of the zygotes do, especially with your given incubators.

"t1_dr4p8nc"	"ProL33T"	NA	"That hypothetical scenario, although it is interesting, it is still very debatable the actions of someone when it comes to the value a person gives to something that might become a human being vs someone that already is one. The key idea one has to keep in mind when they take those examples into account (and this is my opinion) is this:The choice that guarantees the higher number of living is the most optimal outcome, either morally and logically. With this idea in mind, I will scratch the first two examples you gave since they are, in my view, self-explanatory as to why, most people you know would pick the 5 year old child instead of the the zygotes (they could even be 1000). I think that any normal person would, just due to the fact that there isn't any chance that human life will prevail in those zygotes after being saved while, on the side, the 5 year old child would lead to live a life full of experiences and, possibly, create even more life in the process.However, the last two examples you gave are debatable. The main factor when it comes to decide whether I would save a 5 year old child or a 32 week old fetus, is the probability of living (Keep in mind that, in those 2 last examples you gave, the chance of living a live to its fullest extent is possible for the zygotes now). I value anything that has the possibility of becoming something for years to come, I'll always pick the human life with the highest probability of living so that answers the 3rd example (the child). Now, when it comes to the last example, everything changes.. because now I have not only probability but also, quantity as a factor I have to keep in mind. I doubt that a lot of people would pick a 5 year old child over 5 fetuses because those fetuses have a chance of becoming something. I would take the chance and save those 5 fetuses and hope that they would grow up to become something in the future."

The most common reason for having an abortion is that having another child would harm their ability to care for their current family.

I can change your scenario to force you to say that any one life is more or less valuable than another because you are forced to make a choice in a no win scenario. For example, In one room is your mother and in the other is a 5 year old, pick one. Or, in one room there is a 5 year old and in the other room is a 5 year old with Downs syndrome, pick one. I can add more layers to the experiment until I have every possible scenario accounted for which would create a hierarchy of \\"value\\" decided by your choices. Not only is this not an objective way of assigning value, the information gained from the experiment is useless because...... 2) Even if I were to grant you that your thought experiment proves a fetus is of intrinsically lower value compared to a fully developed human, it does not follow that abortion is therefor moral. The choice for abortion isn't \\"I either have to kill this fetus or kill that 5 year old\\" it's \\"I'm okay with killing this fetus\\" because of reason X."

The vast majority (&gt;70%) of women who have abortions in the US have at least one other child and the most common reason for having an abortion is because pregnancy/a new child would put stress (financial and other) on the already existing family unit. So when the choice becomes - I have to kill this fetus or not have enough money to feed my 5 year old or pay for rent for my 5 year old or have time to help my 5 year old with their homework so they can be educated and escape this cycle of poverty - there is a very different moral obligation. And people talk about adoption, but prenatal care itself can cost anywhere from $9,000-250,000 and it’s very hard to know what end of that because predicting who’s going to have a complicated course is very difficult.

I fear that not only is this a slippery slope that can lead to some dark stuff, but it's also disgraceful that we can justify what I consider murder. This is made worse to me when the reasons for wanting to abort are as shallow as not having money or worrying about loss of lifestyle.I I know you will disagree with me on my logic.

As well their are other issues, such as breast feeding multiple babies can be incredibly difficult for mothers.

"t1_dr5gsy8"	"k9centipede"	"5"	"I'm just asking what your views are on those questions. To see how you categorized them. You stated you viewed someone as human as from the moment of conception.

Simply put they are all humans and they are all alive until they die naturally. I don't care if you have one face or eight. Twins are of course individual people and so are conjoined twins. Birth defects are no reason to deny an individual their rights as a human.The real question you should be asking is when do support abortion, so here is one example. There are birth defects so severe that the baby will never actually be \\"alive\\", the baby that was born with no brain springs to mind. In these cases I am pro abortion because if we know conclusively that the baby CANNOT survive outside the mother after full gestation, then the risks of pregnancy and the associated psychological stresses for the parents far outweigh any benefit of giving birth to a dead baby."

And you could corroborate their story by talking to each one individually. Myrtle would probably tell you she is one person. The reality is I don't care, and it doesn't matter because they are both at least one person.

You've already said you're pro life and don't expect to change that, so I'm not interested in your views on abortion. Just in what makes someone a human/person. Since twins share the same conception history, I am curious how you personally classify the splitting that occurs for twins in your view of humanity. So you don't feel comfortable saying if you think Abby and Brittany are two people or not? Why not? I'm not asking what you think they would say, since there are similar cases where those born in similar ways don't advance beyond infancy so you couldn't ask them for insight. The two examples of babies being born with 2 faces both died early on. Who determines of those babies qualify as one or two humans? Do you view [blighted ovums](http://americanpregnancy.org/pregnancy-complications/blighted-ovum/) as humans? An egg is fertilized but then never actually develops and is just an empty sack."
"t1_dr5rs3k"	"McCoolium"	NA	"With twins, a biologically natural process occurred to create a number of individuals, whether it created them via multiple fertilized eggs or by the zygote splitting is irrelevant to me. I consider Brittany and Abby to be two people. But not only does my opinion on that not matter, it doesn't change the outcome of very many circumstances either way.I can't think if too many scenarios where it would matter whether they are one individual with two personalities or two individuals with one body. Maybe if someone murdered Abby and in doing so Brittany died as well, classifying them as individuals would affect the charges laid (one count of murder vs. two) Aside from that I really think that it is their choice.For the two faced baby, I'm not sure if it is one person or two. Probably one, as stated above it doesn't matter to me because it was at least one and it doesn't need to be more than that. As for blighted ovums in humans, I'm not overly familiar with them. But if I understand correctly they are conceived as if they were a normal human baby and extremely early in gestation they stop developing and are miscarried. In my opinion these are humans that failed to develop into a fetus. I classify them as humans because conception occurred."

I know you said before you would just take her word on it, but since you are also pro life I assume you wouldn't take a pregnant woman's word when she declares she and the fetus are just one human at the moment. If you feel personally Myrtle is just one person, Why? You say a blighted ovum should be classified as a human despite the failure to develop, so why would the two clearly separate halves that make up her legs not count individually just because they didn't develop fully? And the Egyptian parasitic twin head? Is that a 2nd person to you? What about when multiple fertilized eggs merge together to form a [chimera](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(genetics))? Do they count as a person for each fertilized egg?"
"t1_dr62edy"	"McCoolium"	NA	"I'm going to set a basic criteria down for you that I would use to determine whether someone is an individual or more than one individual so you can stop asking me these questions and we can move onto something productive. I would classify any form of human that forms as the result of conception, natural or otherwise, to be one human. If that individual then, through any method, splits into multiple forms of sentience, or joins with another form of sentience, while maintaining it's own sentience, then you have multiple humans.A human with an extra face or appendages is one human because the extra parts aren't sentient. I understand that those parts may be there because in the womb one fetus absorbed the other. But the absorbed fetus is now dead and is no longer an individual.Further to that, I want to make to make it clear that it does not matter whether you classify someone as 1 person or as multiple people, as both designations carry the same value and rights making the distinction useless."
"t1_dr662w7"	"k9centipede"	"5"	"Most twin splitting happens within the first week of being fertilized so the mother wouldn't even know she's pregnant so these questions aren't really even relevant to questions about abortions. I was purely curious about the nature of your Humans as Conception belief. And you've answered those questions so thank you. One additional question tho, slightly off topic but relating to one of your responses. You originally said you'd rely on Abby/Brittany and Myrtle to judge what level of personhood they themselves had. Do you respect self-determined labels like that in other classifications, such as Gender?"
"t1_dr68p85"	"McCoolium"	NA	"I would take the self determined label that Brittany/Abby or Myrtle would choose for themselves for several reasons. Mainly because there is quite obviously something unique about them, in that being conjoined twins means they are one of a very small number of conjoined twins to have ever existed. This would be a fraction of a percent of humans.Things start to get muddy with me when it comes to how somebody \\"feels\\". A person with multiple personality disorder can feel like they have several independent personalities living within them. I wouldn't say that there actually are several independent people living within that persons body because there is no scientific reason that I am aware of to believe that that's true. And furthermore, there is consensus that multiple personality disorder is a real mental condition. Now this doesn't take away from the fact that suffers of this condition can believe that they are actually multiple people at the same time.How I feel about people's gender identity falls anywhere between, or up to and including both of the examples above. Some people have a truly unique experience, Some have a real mental issue and many are just plain lying about which gender they identify as. So to answer the question directly, it comes down to specific cases as to whether I would personally respect a self determined classification with regard to gender (which I'm confident there are only two) But i respect entirely that my opinion on the matter is useless because I am not a expert in this field. Edit: I am a live and let live kind of guy, if someone wants to call themselves xir and says they are demi gender, I think they are crazy, but it's their life and as long as they aren't hurting anybody I don't really care."

Killing is held as an immoral act, and the conversation then has to move to whether the fetus is alive enough to matter or if the mother's desires are dominant over the zygote or fetus.Not condemning or affirming abortion, I'm just trying to clarify some things."

You're subordinating it to a whole bunch of other considerations and creating a new concept like \\"justifiable immorality\\". For pretty much the entire use of the term \\"morality\\" the world uses it as the basis for choice, not an \\"ingredient\\" - it's the final summary after all considerations have been accounted for.This means that I think we're having a _semantic_ challenge in our conversation, not necessarily a substantive one!"

The fact that you shouldn't let you baby die seems to be pretty basic.I'd probably just make 1st trimester abortions legal and contraception virtually free.

Now if one wants to make the utilitarian argument that \\"the burden is too high, we need to allow a morally hazardous action to relieve that burden\\", I'm already on board with that argument. Indeed, that's why I support robust abortion rights, and I will continue to do so until we have some system in place (such as socialized medicine + more robust orphan care + better support for poor families) that relieves the burden.But I go into that discussion with my eyes wide open. It is a conflict of rights and preferences. Someone is choosing the moral hazard to end a potentially viable and healthy human life -- an important and severe moral decision -- to relieve a future burden of care that resulted from their choices (in most cases). I think any honest analysis must acknowledge that moral hazard and affirm that personal responsibility."

But hope that abortions are never taken lightly.; Heck, a few hundred years ago newborns weren't even named because the odds of them dying were so high;I agree that there is no bright line, but I think birth is the very minimum for drawing that line. If you persist with the social construct argument along these lines then murder of an unnamed newborn is not immoral. I think the last that we can agree on is that it is immoral. ; If a zygote can't survive outside of the mother then it is fair to come to the conclusion that it isn't a \\"human being\\" quite yet.Humans have a notoriously long gestation period and child rearing years. No newborn can survive unassisted, not for several years at least. With medical assistance, very premature babies are viable. This technology is only improving. So I put it to you that \\"surviving unassisted\\" is not a useful measure of what is our is not a \\"human being\\".; Yes, it has human cells but that doesn't make it a \\"human being\\" anymore than a mole I have removed is a human being.I think this is grossly simplifying the matter. No one is suggesting that a mole is a human being and to make the comparison misses the point. Moles do not have the capacity to grow into a human being. To make the comparison is facetious. ; is it immoral to kill a human being by denying it resources you possess?... If a mother doesn't want to be used as an incubator... [this whole paragraph].I think this is quite irrelevant and inaccurate. You appear to be leading a discussion of whether positive and negative acts should have the same treatment morally. Without going into that debate (which is a very big one in moral philosophy with no easy answers), a potential child in a potential mother should not be equivocated with a stranger in the streets. That mother carries a much more onerous moral responsibility for that potential child. Some might argue that the mother is by default responsible for the potential child it carries. Also, abortion is a positive act, not a negative one. The default position is to not abort. But even taking your position at its highest, neglect by a mother is considered immoral by most.So I guess what is left is that people agree that a birthed child is a person, and it's definitely immoral to kill. Before that, who knows, it's subjective as you say, but the later in the term it is, the more person it seems to be. It's futile to take the \\"when is it a person\\" argument to establish whether abortion is immoral. It is useful for questioning when the limit for abortion should be. But naught else. I prefer to couch the argument on the mother, how it affects her, what if it is a reluctant mother, and fairly well established harm to society where reluctant or under resourced mothers cannot abort. If the focus is on the mother, then you are entertaining the loss to a maybe human against the loss of an actual human. The actual human has many years of life lived, sunk cost. She has much to lose. The maybe human on the other hand, well, people are still deciding if it's a human. And if it eventually becomes a human, it is already at a disadvantaged if it's born to a reluctant mother. In that respect, I agree with OP. It's (probably) immoral but definitely the lesser of two evils.Edit: oops this was written in reply to /r/Paul_aka_paul. Was typing on my phone :("

The mole on your (insert location here) has no potential to do so; it is a collection of cells differentiated to serve a purpose (albeit to simply exist as a benign feature on the surface of your skin).Moreover, if I was to analyze the genetic content of a mole on a pregnant woman, I'd find *her* genome: the 46 chromosomes that entail the genetic information needed to create and maintain her. The same would not be true for her embryo: its genome would entail a reconfigured, unique chromosomal arrangement/pairing, thanks to meiosis - sharing similarities but nevertheless distinct from that of both parents.; A human being is something that isn't really defined by science - it is a moral or social construct that we put around a person.Again, I disagree. Science clearly defines the 7 characteristics required to be considered alive, namely:1. Living things are composed of cells.2. Living things have different levels of cellular organization/ levels of organization.3. Living things use energy4. Living things respond to their environment.5. Living things grow.6. Living things reproduce.7. Living things adapt to their environment.A human being, *Homo sapiens sapiens*, is also defined clearly in terms of its wilde-type genetic composition and physiological characteristics. While you could make the argument that consciousness is what defines a human, that also carries its own set of problems: is grandpa no longer human because he's unconscious on an ICU bed? How do we determine when consciousness is in effect? Memory? I can't remember anything about the first 2 years of my life; does that mean I wasn't human?The point I am trying to illustrate is that, scientifically, I can define a wilde-type human being (and whether or not a human being is alive) accurately and consistently, given room for clearly defined exceptions (e.g. children at the age of 5 are alive, despite being incapable of reproduction at that stage of development, humans with genetic abnormalities are also considered humans, albeit mutations from the wilde-type).; Heck, a few hundred years ago newborns weren't even named because the odds of them dying were so high; \\"personhood\\" wasn't really bestowed on them until later in life when odds of survival were higher.How long ago exactly? And why are past notions/ideas of what constitutes life considered relevant to contemporary knowledge? There was a point in time where physical illness was considered a result of imbalanced humors. Historically, it is an interesting point of observation. Scientifically, it has no merit, since our knowledge base has expanded to allow for a much more accurate definition. The same holds true for the definition of a human.; If a zygote can't survive outside of the mother then it is fair to come to the conclusion that it isn't a \\"human being\\" quite yet.Define survive? An infant/toddler also cannot survive without extensive effort from its parents outside the womb. Are you defining it as the capacity to biologically function outside the womb? What does that interpretation mean for humans who survive only due to current medical technology, such as patients attached to life support systems? What about humans who would not have the capacity to survive outside of modern-day society, due to life-threatening disorders, such as harlequin ichthyosis?Why choose the moment of birth as the arbitrary point in the developmental cycle of a human being where a human can be considered human? Abortion is a disruption of that natural developmental cycle that would lead to the existence of a fully functional and developed human - approximately 25 years down the line (the point at which full maturity is reached and the human body transitions into maintaining its capacity to function for as long as possible).For the record, I hold that abortion is murder, but none-the-less a necessary evil that has its purpose in society.**EDIT:** My comment is relevant to the discussion at hand.

If blood is found, they can test it and determine that it is human blood. They can dig up bones thousands of years old and tell you not only that they are human bones, but they can even tell you something of the life of the human. Humans have DNA that is distinct from the DNA of other animals and plants.You are confusing \\"personhood\\" which is supposedly a legal/moral definition with human, which is a scientific definition. The two terms aren't interchangeable in this context. There's no need to go to all the effort to deny that unborn humans are human. The law and our moral codes already allow for the lawful/ethical/moral killing of humans in some circumstances. You are on your way to the argument one human is not responsible for the life of another human. Stick with that. Denying that a unborn baby is human is dumb and isn't going to convince a pro-lifer."

"t1_dr585th"	"currytacos"	NA	"Wrote this from my phone so if might not be perfect spelling.Personally i would say having seperate dna to your parents and a heartbeat qualifying as a human beign. But as you mentioned its pretty much a moot point in this respect because its a moral definition on both sides of the argument. But heres my problem with the viability aspect to this argument. A baby in New York City would be a viable baby much sooner than a baby born in rural Georgia because of available medical practices. To me, it seems immoral to make laws about killing when there is no clear line of when its a life. I would rather go on the safe side. But nonetheless it is assigning more value to a baby in a rich area than a poor area. Youre argument for the babies in middle ages also doesnt work for me, its killing a perspective life versus trying to keep it alive even if it probably wont make it. Its like saying an old person that needs oxygen isnt a viable life so theyre not a person. To your second argument, if you hit someone with your car are you morally obligated to pay for the medical bills? Its not like pregnancy is something that randomly happens. You have control over it no matter what. Even if its not the \\"fun\\" option. You have, birth control, condoms, and the most sure way, abstinence. Now pregnancy is, i guess, a consequence of sex. But one that still entails a human life. So should we be saying that your convinience is more important than this potential life? Personally i dont think we should. If you affect some ones life, you are held accountable. Creating a life is no exception. Then for the argument that didnt come up. It is almost impossible to adopt kids right now and there are a lot of hopeful parents without any means to get kids.With that said, if it is the product of rape, or there are complications that puts the mother in more danger.

When you kick a homeless guy out of your home or business, yes, he might die in the cold, but then again he might not. That's why people don't consider it immoral, or at least part of it. If your response to seeing a homeless guy passively sitting in your store or living room, and your immediate reaction was to get your shotgun and blow his head off, the reaction there might be a bit different.I understand there's more or less no way to perform an abortion without killing the fetus, which is why I think the analogy doesn't hold up.

Yet when speaking of the future and of potential, we use the word that describes what we know it *will be*, rather than what it is.The same is true for a zygote. We may refer to it as \\"the baby\\" because when we imagine our plans for it, we imagine them with it having become a baby.

All of that only kicks in when the baby is born. It takes extra resources to care for a growing zygote just as it does a growing baby or child, but we only provide tax credits after birth.I could keep going and going with these examples. Instead, I'd ask the same question of you. Other than the fact that a zygote is sometimes called a baby (which, as I stated in my comment above, really doesn't indicate at all that we think it *is* a baby, just that it *will be* one) in a future sense, can you list any ways that our society *does* treat a zygote or a fetus as indistinguishable from a baby or child?"

Arguing that there is a difference between a potential person on the basis of viability vs an actual person is a fundamentally unsound argument because 1) modern science and medicine is moving that line everyday and 2) there is a just as sound argument that humans don't reach viability until pre-pubescence. If an infant appears next to you it has no ability to survive without direct expenditure of energy and resources from your body. However In most societies you would still be considered morally, ethically and even legally responsible to make an effort to save that infant in most situations despite the energy and resource cost to your body, yet that is used as an argument for early termination of a soon to be \\"viable\\" fetus.

"t1_dr4t3x3"	"rookiebatman"	NA	"&gt; Right, but doesn't the way our society refers to zygotes (examples in post) imply that we consider them human beings? If there weren't any examples of our society giving special value to zygotes, then sure I'd agree.If your argument hinges on how our society (including people who consider abortion to be immoral) refers to zygotes, then doesn't your argument essentially boil down to \\"abortion is unavoidably immoral, because some people think abortion is immoral?\\"And by the way, to your last couple bullet points in the OP, are we talking about zygotes (just a fertilized egg) or are we talking about late-term pregnancies (practically the same as a baby that's been born)? Those are very different moral questions, and I don't think it's fair to lump them in together. That would be kinda like saying we all agree it's wrong to attack a saintly person who never hurt anybody, therefore it's also wrong to attack someone who's trying to rape and murder your daughter. There's clearly a spectrum here, and it doesn't make sense to use one end against the other."
"t1_dr5c8rt"	"DGChiefs"	NA	"That is a disingenuous equivalency since I think we can all agree that the rapist murderer will not soon become a saintly person without major intervention, why as a zygote will soon become a late term fetus without major intervention. It is absolutely fair to group them together."
"t1_dr5cyxb"	"rookiebatman"	NA	"So we should determine what rights or moral value an organism should have based on what it will presumably become, rather than what it is?"
"t1_dr5e5yq"	"DGChiefs"	NA	"What is the meaningful difference between something's current status, and something's immanent status with little interference?"
"t1_dr8ohst"	"WDMC-905"	NA	"a simple example would be, death. every living person has the potential for death, it is *imminent* and inescapable.do you question a meaningful difference between dead and not dead?"
"t1_dr5nngm"	"rookiebatman"	NA	"Allow me to answer with an example. When an elderly person is considered too old and feeble to take care of themselves, it is not considered immoral by most people to place them in a retirement home, even if you are doing so against their will (basically putting someone in a fairly cushy prison for no greater crime than living too long). Now, if we accept the premise that it makes sense to \\"determine what rights or moral value an organism should have based on what it will presumably become, rather than what it is,\\" then it seems to me that it would logically follow that we could take someone who's 40 years old (in good health), and put them in a retirement home against their will too, because they will eventually become old and feeble without major intervention. I don't think that makes sense. I don't think it makes sense to give young children the right to drive or drink or vote, because they'll be old enough to handle the responsibility eventually, and I don't think it makes sense to treat a single cell comprised of the union of sperm and egg as if it were a full-fledged person, just because that's what it will become eventually if nothing happens to prevent that (and a lot happens to foster and protect it). I know of no other issue besides abortion where anyone ever argues that a human's rights and privileges should be conferred based on what they will become, rather than what they currently are."
"t1_dr58kx2"	"nowlistenhereboy"	NA	"You should maybe consider the fact that the vast majority of people have an incredibly poor understanding of basic human biology, let alone the stages of fetal development. The average person couldn't even tell you at what point the heart or brain develops or becomes self sustaining. So basing your idea of morality on 'society' is very democratic of you but it isn't necessarily true that society, as a whole, is equipped to make the correct choices on all subjects."
"t1_dr3rj9l"	"Ansuz07"	"241"	"&gt; Right, but doesn't the way our society refers to zygotes (examples in post) imply that we consider them human beings? If there weren't any examples of our society giving special value to zygotes, then sure I'd agree.The way our society treats them varies from case to case. In some areas we treat them as people, in some areas we don't. Parents who want a child will see it as a person, but a women who does not may not agree.There isn't consensus on this issue at all.;This reminds me of the church guy in Texas who everybody hated because he closed the doors of his church during the Hurricane. Society seemed to consider that an immoral act.Yes, but again, that is case by case. I live in Houston and I was mad a Olstein for not opening his doors, but I didn't open my doors either. No one is raking me over the coals for it, so clearly it isn't a black and white issue. We can see people's obligation to help as different based on their role in society and the community. It is possible to believe that a mother does not have an obligation to use her body in this way."
"t1_dr4atqm"	"freckled_porcelain"	NA	"To be fair, churches operate almost exclusively on donations from their congregation, so they probably expected to be offered shelter. They tend to be built as emergency shelters, the same as most schools. Not really the same as someone's personal home."

"t1_dr6g88w"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"yes, my neighborbut typically eulogies are held in celebration of one's life.

Your point isn't very well thought out nor conssitent"
"t1_dr4llqs"	"clev3rbanana"	NA	"Pretty sure most pro-choice people argue that it should be the mother's choice up to 6 months and a quarter (when the third trimester is up and there's a high chance of fetal viability) not all the way up until birth. I'm pretty liberal, but I disagree with late term abortions (past viability) unless it will save the mother or in cases of rape/incest.So yes, it's a child the minute before it's out of the womb, imo."
"t1_dr4m684"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"So is the barometer you're using viability?"
"t1_dr4mdet"	"clev3rbanana"	NA	"Yep, fetal viability/third trimester. Really, 6.25 months (25 weeks) is the widely accepted timeframe for viability since that's usually when the chance of survival is past 50%, but I'm okay with it lowered to 5.5 months (22 weeks) which is when the chance of survival outside of the womb is a nonzero."
"t1_dr4n3bh"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"alright, so given that medical technology approaches better and better everyday are you willing to eventually go to 0 days once we get their technologically?also when you use the term viability can you expand on that? do you mean doesn't need to be sustained?"
"t1_dr4u62v"	"T3rkish"	NA	"Can you give an example of this technology and research towards this type of technology?"
"t1_dr4vj2c"	"zip_000"	NA	"I think there are a lot of measures and considerations that have to be taken into account. Viability is sort of the front line measure. If we one day develop the technology to have a newly fertilized egg teleported out of a woman's Fallopian tubes and into a device so viability is no longer a consideration, then other considerations would become more central.Consider the life of an unwanted child, growing up knowing that you were not wanted... a lot of people live that life now, and they will give you complicated and varying answers about this.Consider the scarcity of resources on the planet and the compromises that will have to be made for each additional person added to it.Consider the ethical question about your rights to your own genetic material. A bit farther afield, but something that should be considered.There is a whole host of issues that we don't really have to consider too often at this point because the viability line gives us some breathing room on those. We've mostly drawn the line there and mostly seen that as a reasonable compromise. That line will undoubtedly change eventually though."
"t1_dr4m6ba"	"KrazyKestral"	"1"	"Most people agree on yes. Around 26-28 weeks is when most fetuses are viable outside the womb. That is as good of a line to draw as any. I.e. if an emergency birth was done, the baby has a decent chance of survival. It becomes a moot point with better science though."
"t1_dr4m6xi"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"Right, so the question now becomes is it viability that's your standard?"
"t1_dr4mcqa"	"KrazyKestral"	"1"	"Yes. In my view, a woman should not have to provide her body for use in creating life. Thus, an abortion is not so much about killing the fetus as it is the woman exercising her bodily rights. With modern science, early fetuses die without a body to grow in."
"t1_dr4n462"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"so does the child deserve its right to life? Do you get to infringe on someones life in the interest of your liberty?"
"t1_dr4ndd1"	"KrazyKestral"	"1"	"A fetus is not a someone yet. Nor is it a child.A woman is responsible for a fetus in that it's her body the fetus is growing in. To use a famous example, imagine you wake up with a person medically attached to you, who needs to use your blood/liver/body in order to survive. Are you morally obligated to let them? Would it be wrong for you to unattach them, even if you know they will die without use of your body?"
"t1_dr4o0ey"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"Right, but earlier you said its a child when it's a minute from popping out. The distinction you've drawn from fetus/child is very much an arbitrary line especially according to a quick Wikipedia search it's still considered a fetus when it's a minute from being born.;To use a famous example, imagine you wake up with a person medically attached to you, who needs to use your blood/liver/body in order to survive. Are you morally obligated to let them?That's not a fair example at all, one I am in no way responsible for this person attached to me or the creation of this person. A woman has a part in the creation of her child. Secondly if a woman does nothing to remove the child they birth Naturally. That is a human. This would be akin to me saying \\"should I have the right to end life support for my friend assuming he's recovering and will be perfectly healthy in 9 mos.\\"That example is entirely intellectually dishonest because it's trying to propose magical hypotheticals to score points. People don't wake up with people attached to them. The overwhelming majority of the time when a woman gets pregnant it's because if an action she undertook willingly. That person she's carrying has rights to. You don't just get to end someone's rights because they inconvenience your life, especially when you are specifically at fault for their creation."
"t1_dr4o8jn"	"KrazyKestral"	"1"	"1. Pregnancy and birth are *incredibly* exhausting and physically dangerous activities.

As I believe they are inherently different, no argument about the former having personal rights (including a right to life) will be effective to me. A fetus is not a person, so abortion can't be murder. It's surgery.I believe that it is irresponsible to create a new person that you can't take care of, can't afford, and/or don't want, when you have the choice."
"t1_dr4p0o3"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"&gt;1. Pregnancy and birth are *incredibly* exhausting and physically dangerous activities. Women should not be required to endure them because of a mistake that TWO people made. Additionally, pregnancy and birth are not without labor.Right but that's justifying likely murder over exhaustion it kinda falls apart in comparison. And two people could have made the mistake and two people are responsible for the mistake and neither of them is allowed to end the life of another just because it inconveniences them.;2. You haven't provided any reason why a 4-week old fetus should have the same rights as an 8-month old fetus. As I believe they are inherently different, no argument about the former having personal rights (including a right to life) will be effective to me. A fetus is not a person, so abortion can't be murder. It's surgery.It's not on me to argue on your behalf. I believe even at 4 weeks it's still a human. Developing sure but it's a human life and I think murder is wrong no matter how young. A 5 yr old is still developing into an adult, murder is wrong for the same reason.;As I believe they are inherently different,Right, but facts don't care about your feelings. Does a child in development magically become human at 4.1 weeks and before it isn't? What magical thing happened that makes it a child before and suddenly it becomes one? It sounds like you've arbitrarily drawn a line and you aren't particularly defining where or why that line is there and why.;A fetus is not a person, so abortion can't be murder.Well we can use that logic to argue some interesting things. Firstly, a fetus(child) coming through the birth canal is not a person so we can inject poison into its skull, Vaccum out its brains, and crush its skull because it isn't a human? That isn't murder? Of what if I said \\"a toddler isn't an adult so infanticide can't be murder\\". Or what if I said \\"marooning someone on an desert island where they have no chance to survive is abandonment it isn't murder\\"Much like my examples I gave you, going and getting an abortion takes an action. Killing a toddler is an positive (meaning it's something I have to do) action. Marooning somone on an island is a positive action. Abortion is a positive action. Left untouched that child is born and develops into an adult. You have no right to strip a person of their rights for convenience. You have no right to murder someone because they are a burden to you or society.It doesn't matter how much of an inconvenience they are. The only possible time taking a life is justified is in life or death self defense. With modern medicine, the mother is almost never at risk.;I believe that it is irresponsible to create a new person that you can't take care of, can't afford, and/or don't want, when you have the choice.Totally agree with you, I just don't think I get to murder people because they were irresponsible. Two things can be true at once. The parents were foolish and unfit to be parents and they shouldn't be allowed to kill children because they're irresponsible."
"t1_dr4piky"	"KrazyKestral"	"1"	"I'm not asking you to make my argument for me, I'm explaining that your argument will be ineffective until you can convince me that fetuses are (or should be considered equal to) persons. The line between lump of flesh and person may be arbitrary since it's so gradual, however it is something that needs to be defined."
"t1_dr4pmzv"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"It's a fetus until it exists the birth canal. You already said you'd consider a child (or fetus) a mere minute from being born both alive and a child. You are admitting a fetus is a child.;The line between lump of flesh and person may be arbitrarily Except its not. There is no other time in life where people magically confuse lumps of flesh for humans. You don't do it when it's someone you're talking to in Bangladesh helping you with your iPhone and you can't see them. You don't do it when you want to keep your pregnancy \\"we're having a baby\\". Why does it magically transfer to a lump of flesh upon the wills of a person who is responsible for its creation? Your standard isn't consistent nor logical. I urge you to reconsider it."
"t1_dr4pvhg"	"KrazyKestral"	"1"	"You're projecting other people's ideas (of when a fetus turns into a person) onto me, which is a fallacy.I don't believe a fetus becomes a person at birth, and I haven't said as such. I'll reiterate what I said earlier - I believe a fetus should be considered a person when it can physically survive outside of the womb, which is around 26-28 weeks."
"t1_dr4q8a5"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"right, except I assume since you're using the term fetus you're referring to the medical definition which means its a fetus when it's in the womb. Or maybe you're just picking and choosing what to call a fetus, alright, why?I want to make a point that isn't often made and I've been dancing around it because I'm not fond of attacking people. You're playing a word game to rationalize your decision. \\"It's ok if I kill a fetus but not a child\\". Alright, what separates a child from a fetus?\\"well when it's 26 weeks old\\"so if it was 25 weeks 6 days day its alright to kill it but just a merely 24 hrs it is? what happens on that magical day that makes it alright to kill it just 24 hrs before? How does one day change murder to \\"a surgery\\".How does a \\"fetus\\" magically transform into a child. The word game your playing does two things. One, it insulates you from the consequences of what you're advocating in a way to make yourself feel safe or comfortable and avoid cognitive dissonance. \\"I'm not killing a child, I'm terminating a fetus\\". That's a lie and it's intellectually cowardly. Have a standard, go ahead but I want you to hold to it. I want you to think about why you believe what you do and defend it to me if you genuinely think that's whats right.So lets use viability, and since this test works for children it should work for adults too. If you have a failing liver and won't survive without a dialysis machine are you considered viable? What if you need weekly blood transfusions from donors? are you not considered viable? you won't survive without those transfusions which we need other people to donate blood so you mus't be viable? Is murder justified for these people? can we kill them becasue they aren't viable? What if you break your leg hiking in the wilderness of Alaska, are you no longer considered viable considering you will depend on another human being to survive?You used the term \\"viability\\". Alright, medical technology is getting better all the time. Soon maybe a 1 week child will be considered viable. Are you alright reducing the time abortions are allowed to only 1 week after conception? what about at 25 weeks and 6 days? What do you mean by viable?"
"t1_dr4rmrd"	"KrazyKestral"	"1"	"Since a fetus becoming a baby is a gradual change, the line between not-person and person has to be put somewhere. 26 weeks is as good as any. Realistically speaking, most ([98.7%](https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/data_stats/abortion.htm)) abortions are performed up to the 20th week, which is well before any 2X week 'personhood' cut off that I have suggested. Also, remember that most late-stage abortions are wanted babies that have to be aborted, usually due to a medical emergency or complication.As far as viability...a fetus cannot break its legs by hiking in Alaska, because it may not even have legs yet. Any and all blood transfusions would come from it's direct connection into its mother's blood supply, and if it needed dialysis it would use its mother's liver, because the mother is the person it's growing on. There is no reason to consider it as an individual with individual rights until it actually becomes an individual. When we have the technology to grow a fetus into a baby from fertilization (or 1 week), it would be much more productive to use it to save wanted babies from medical emergencies, not to grow a baby out of an accidental pregnancy.In any case, I'm not going to be able to convince you that abortions are ok because you believe all fetuses are people and abortion is murder. For the opposite reason, you also won't be able to convince me that abortion is wrong or should be illegal."
"t1_dr4rqs7"	"McDrMuffinMan"	"1"	"I'm trying to get a consistent answer from you that's why I gave you examples, I wasn't implying the fetus was doing those activities, I was arguing your term viability.;When we have the technology to grow a fetus into a baby from fertilization(or 1 week)will you support a ban on abortion then because they would now be all viable? thats the million dollar question here."

"t1_dr5bfi1"	"DGChiefs"	NA	"Ok so a few questions: 1) Are you against murder? 2) Why is murder ethically, morally, and legally wrong? 3) How does that definition not cover fetuses? My answer to 1) would be yes. 2) Murder deprives someone of their future potential liberty, choices, and experiences. 3) fetuses are covered because you are depriving their future potential liberty, choices, and experiences. Viability is a fundamentally unsound argument because 1) modern science and medicine is moving that line everyday and 2) there is a just as sound argument that humans don't reach viability until pre-pubescence. If an infant appears next to you it has no ability to survive without direct expenditure of energy and resources from your body. However In most societies you would still be considered morally, ethically and even legally responsible to make an effort to save that infant in most situations despite the energy and resource cost to your body, yet that is used as an argument for early termination of a soon to be \\"viable\\" fetus. Fundamentally unsound argument."
"t1_dr4mn8c"	"Aim_2_misbehave"	NA	"For most pro-choice people, yes. Before viability, it is incapable or life outside the body of the mother, and as such is subject to a woman's right to make decisions regarding her body and her health. A pregnant woman is a person in her own right, while a fetus that's incapable of sustaining life outside the womb, isn't; therefore the mother's rights trump the rights of the fetus."

"t1_dr3rlrf"	"IamNotChrisFerry"	"9"	"We kill humans a lot. I don't agree with all of the following but here's some deaths people are ok with-someone killing someone else in self defense-executioner killing a death row in mate-a soldier killing an enemy compantant-congress authorizing the use of drones to kill enemy combatants-a president ordering a drone strike on enemy combatants- a police officer shooting an uncooperative suspect- a police officer shooting a hostage taker-a doctor ending the life of a terminal patient- a drunk driver killing a bystander- a cigarette company selling cigarettes to people- a pharmacuetical company selling a product with death as a know possible side effect- a hunter accidently shooting a hunting partner- a coal company cutting costs resulting in deaths of workersThe list goes on. But most people don't need to refer to those beings as zygotes, or suspects, compatants to make killing a human ok. Those people are usually still considered human by people who are ok with their lives being ended.The same could be said of a fetus (or whichever pre birth stage) . It's a human, but it's just one of those many times society deems killing humans ok."
"t1_dr3rmmg"	"DCarrier"	"20"	"&gt; It is immoral to kill human beingsIt's immoral to kill *people*. If you find some alien race that's intelligent, it's bad to kill them even though they're not people. If you have a petri dish full of [HeLa cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HeLa), it's fine to kill them even though they are human.Not everyone agrees where the line is. Some people think it's okay to kill a cow just because you think beef tastes good. Others don't. But we all draw the line somewhere. A fetus that hasn't developed neurons yet is no smarter than a plant. There's no reason to be okay with killing the latter and not the former.; It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.You could say that about any point in time. It's not really logical to think of a sperm and egg having no value, but the moment they touch they suddenly have value. But either that happens somewhere or it's a gradual increase in value and if you have the abortion early enough it doesn't matter very much."
"t1_dr3rng4"	"GabuEx"	"5"	"&gt;It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.I think reasonable people would agree with the following two statements:1. A fertilized egg is not a full human life at the moment of conception.2. A baby *is* a full human life at the moment of birth.If we accept those two notions, then there must come a time in between those two points at which it transitions into being something that one would call a human life. One can debate on when that should be, but once you have that point, then any abortion before that point does not strike me as something where the argument for its immorality is remotely a slam-dunk.Consider the following:- Before 5 weeks of embryonic development, there is no beating heart.- Before 10 weeks of fetal development, most internal organs are absent.- Before 12 weeks of fetal development, there is no detectable brain activity.Would we consider a human to be alive if it has no heartbeat, no internal organs, and no brain activity? I would think the answer would be no.To be clear, I would certainly argue that an abortion close to the expected delivery date would be very difficult to differentiate from infanticide. But before 12, 10, or 5 weeks? It's very hard for me to see a good argument for abortion at that point to be equivalent to murder."
"t1_dr4hf0b"	"remake7"	NA	"I would recommend going to the following link:http://www.justfacts.com/abortion.aspIt shows whats active at what time of development. At just 9 weeks the preborn human moves body parts without outside stimulation. Which suggest it is conscious to some extent at just 9 weeks. It appears most abortion laws around the world allow abortions up to 20 weeks."
"t1_dr4lg3q"	"GabuEx"	"5"	"&gt;Which suggest it is conscious to some extent at just 9 weeks.It's hard to say that for sure. There's no detectable brain activity until several weeks after that, so it's entirely possible that that's just akin to a heartbeat in terms of a muscle action that has no higher thought influencing it.That said though, my point was that there exists *some* period of time after conception when it seems pretty undeniable to me that abortion definitely does not result in the loss of anything a reasonable person would consider a human life. There can be reasonable debate over how long that period should be considered, but that's a separate question."
"t1_dr7u3u5"	"remake7"	NA	"I would agree to an extent that there is no loss of a person (From a materialistic world view) during a particular period after conception. But even then, although there is no apparent conscious experience, I would consider potential for conscious experience as something to take into consideration. Imagine instead of the fetus developing in the womb an unconscious baby appears out of no where and is attached to you by an umbilical cord. It only survives by the umbilical cord and remains attached until it becomes conscious 9 months later. Would it be wrong to cut the umbilical cord?"
"t1_dr3rr6j"	"VredeJohn"	"2"	"Is it immoral to kill a brain dead person? If someone is brain dead, with no hope of recovery and is being kept alive only by outside forces (respirators, tube feeding), is it wrong to kill them? They are definitely still a human being, and arguably much closer to a person then a zygote, but most people would feel comfortable turning off the respirator."
"t1_dr3rwhx"	"ThomasEdmund84"	"9"	"Most acts aren't straight immoral or moral, they are a chaos of different factors that are often impossible to completely resolve.I actually tend to agree with you, I'm pro-choice because I believe the ethical decision making is in the mother's hands not the stands, I'm not pro-choice because I believe that abortion is ethically benign.BUT I don't think its easy to conclude that abortion is an immoral act. Yes most people think its wrong to end another humans life, however in almost all other cases other humans do not have such an impact on the decision makers life. When taking about abortion people tend to minimize parental impact, parenting is like the hardest thing that people ever do for people who *intentionally* have children. Also it's important to acknowledge that abortion isn't technically ending a life as removing a pregnancy that happens to require that an unborn child dies.Think of it like this. A random alien attaches itself to your body and starts to suck nutrients from you. The alien informs you that should you sever that tie it will in fact die. It also informs you that in 9 months it will painfully and riskily detach from you, however you still have to provide for is for 18+ years. Now its morally wrong to simply kill other creatures, however is it morally wrong to severe that tube of your own volition? You're not necessarily acting to *kill* them you're acting to maintain your own autonomy.Pro-lifers at this point start extolling the virtues of abstinence, regardless of your views on this I thinks its at the very least fair to say that its too complex to simply conclude abortion is immoral. Sorry I've waffled for ages, I probably could have summed this up:tl;dr no abortion isn't ethically benign but its complicated enough to warrant not coming to a solid 'this is wrong' conclusion."
"t1_dr4bb79"	"jaimedieuetilmaime"	NA	"So you consider abortion to be more akin to the removal of life support than the active killing of another human? At what point does this argument not stand? 20 week old babies and under (up to 14 weeks, I believe) have begun to survive outside the womb even without artificial wombs. So is any abortion where the infant could be relocated to the NICU (14 weeks and later) murder? And as technology creates more aid for premature babies, does that deadline shorten? And what do you think of [this article](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/02/516280895/embryo-experiments-reveal-earliest-human-development-but-stir-ethical-debate)?"

"t1_dr4fczk"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"Well here's the thing though, the alien in your example randomly comes up and attaches to you. However, a baby is created, usually because you willingly had sex, but didn't take the necessary steps to prevent the pregnancy. There are many options: diaphragms, male condom, birth control, foams, morning after pill, etc. All the issues come AFTER the fact that you made the decision to have sex in the first place. No one forced you to have sex, in this example at least. I'm only talking about voluntary sex. You decided, and there are consequences to that. The alien is a separate entity that you had no control over whatsoever. A pregnancy however is something that came about as a direct result of your actions."
"t1_dr4gjda"	"ThomasEdmund84"	"9"	"That may complicate the issue but it doesn't make it conclusively wrong."
"t1_dr4hfdk"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"I think that if no one is forcing you to have sex, and it's your own personal choice, then it is your responsibility when you have a child."
"t1_dr4hx60"	"ThomasEdmund84"	"9"	"It is - ergo the choice to have an abortion"
"t1_dr4i11s"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"Or just have less safe or safe sex? Why do you think most middle income kids don't have kids until they're in the late 20's? Because they know it's not responsible to have a kid and they'd rather wait until they're financially secure."
"t1_dr4jca4"	"DOCisaPOG"	NA	"If you argue that abortions are justified in cases of rape but not in other situations, then you agree that in some cases the needs of the women outweigh the needs of the fetus. Now we need to establish at what point we draw that line."
"t1_dr4jr50"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"How about if you have sex and get pregnant, you should abort it on your own dime. That way you realize the responsibility you have, and you'll be more responsible because abortion is expensive. Otherwise, have safe sex or less sex. Get on birth control, get a diaphragm, male condoms, and a host of other contraceptives give you up to a 99% chance of blocking pregnancy. If you are not taking some of these steps, you're being irresponsible. You should pay for your own mistakes. If you don't, you destroy the incentive to be responsible, and a lot more people become less responsible because they don't have to pay for it. If a business fails, they failed because they were doing something wrong. They were either providing a service or good people didn't need, it was too expensive, it was defective or whatever the reason is. They should be allowed to fail. No one should be responsible for paying for their failures except themselves. You take the risk. If you take the risk away, then they will act more recklessly. The government guaranteed sub-prime loans to Fannie Mae. Fannie Mae refused to take certain loans because there was too much risk attached to it. The government told them they had to and not to worry because the government would guarantee the sub prime loans. So what did Fannie Mae do? They capitalized on a risk free loan, because the gov't guaranteed it, and bought as many subprime loans as possible. If the government hadn't guaranteed them then they wouldn't have taken out the loans. If tomorrow, the government said, \\"If your business fails, we will subsidize it.\\", every single person out there would take as many loans as humanly possible and start businesses and when 99% of them fail because they weren't thought out at all, they will go to the government for their handouts. But people don't do that right now because they would take the risk and fail. That risk of failure is the only thing keeping people from spending their money recklessly. It's a natural part of the free market that forces you to think responsibly. A policy of personal responsibility fosters more responsible people. A policy of no fault because of society will foster less responsible people. I'd rather not live in a society that decides that just because I make 500 dollars more than them a year, they can now come take that away from me. I've had a pretty shitty life. Does that give me the right to rob and steal from you? I don't think so."
"t1_dr4u5rf"	"DOCisaPOG"	NA	"It seems you're much more concerned with the fiscal side of the matter than the moral side. Nailing down the net cost to society of an abortion vs carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term and surrendering the child in an orphanage is an argument that could go on for days."
"t1_dr4vbuv"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"If you're worried about morality, no one is stopping you from donating everything after $30k to someone making less than you. No one is stopping you from volunteering your time at a soup kitchen. The fact of the matter is, if you want, there are dozens of avenues and ways to help someone in need. You can start a gofundme for the homeless or start a charitable group. You can donate as much as you want or as little as you want. However the government, being as ineffective and irresponsible as it is, can't seem to solve the problems with trillions of dollars. The government itself doesn't earn money. The only way to get money is to tax the people in the country. You have to remember that while a business aims for profit, it's dependent on your whims. A business has to sell you a good or service in return for your money. It's a voluntary exchange. If you don't need or want it, you don't have to buy it. It can't force you to buy a product. So for instance, if you had issues with Nike's child slavery in the 90's, you had the choice and the vote with your dollar to not buy their products. Government agencies and departments are supposed to fix a problem in society. When governments can regulate certain businesses and industries, that gives them the power to benefit certain businesses. That's how lobbying occurs. If the government itself couldn't affect business with regulation, there would be no reason for lobbyists because the government wouldn't have power to benefit them in certain ways, ie regulate another competitor out of business, make things advantageous for them, etc. Another point is that bureaucrats and gov't agency workers are not elected like politicians. They do not directly answer to the people. On top of that, while a department is created to solve a problem, in order for those people to retain those jobs, they have to not solve the problem. As in, they will have job longevity if the problem is not solved. Their primary motive is not to solve the problem, but to keep their job as long as possible. At least in the free market, your whims are judged by the consumer's dollars. At least there's a way for bad businesses to fail. In the government, bad agencies are given more and more money. If you're business is failing, no matter how much money you throw at it, it will keep failing. That's what government does. It just adds more and more money to a problem hoping to fix it, but they don't even understand all the variables that go into solving the problem. And some problems can't be solved with just money thrown into the system."
"t1_dr4vq4s"	"DOCisaPOG"	NA	"Again, this conversation isn't at all about government regulations or funding. We are trying to come to a consensus about if the termination of a fetus is moral or immoral."
"t1_dr4w49u"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"The government shouldn't be in it whatsoever. In my opinion, the best situation would be to terminate as soon as you find out and you don't want it.

All I can do is try to convince you with my opinion if you so choose to hear it."
"t1_dr5coal"	"DOCisaPOG"	NA	"Ok, that makes sense now. You and I are in agreement. To bring it back to OP's question, does that mean the act of abortion is immoral in all cases and we have just agreed as a society that some immoral things are acceptable, or can abortion be considered moral in some cases?Also, as a side question, do you mentioned \\"the best situation would be to terminate as soon as you find out and you don't want it. As soon as possible before the heart starts beating and the organs start forming.\\" Is that a hard line you draw in terms of when abortion is taken off the table, or is it just more preferable to a more developed fetus? Does the level of development of the fetus play into how immoral or moral a termination would be?"
"t1_dr5hlyw"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"It is immoral in all cases, but humans put their own comfort ahead of others, so it's not unnatural. I think it would moral in cases of incest/rape. With underage teens it gets a bit murky. We don't think children understand the full consequences of their actions so they're given leeway. Even though I think it's immoral in all cases, I think earlier is better if possible. In a perfect world I would prefer the morning after pill for abortions constantly or no abortions at all. But then my fiscally conservative side asks who will pay for the welfare and care of the children born and put into the foster care system? I heard 50% of the children either die in the streets or go to prison within 2 years of aging out of the system. That's a pretty damn horrible future to leave a child to. Which is better? I don't know."
"t1_dr5hu5y"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"Our society has deemed it moral to abort a child if a women chooses to have sex, gets pregnant as a result, and does not want the baby. At the same time, do I want a child to be born with resentment towards it? No. Do I want responsibility of the mother? Yes. Do I want the child to be raised in a foster home environment as a ward of the state? No. But the real world is not always black and white and our morals are tested in those times."
"t1_dr4vtz5"	"Jukebawks"	NA	"You have to realize that there should be a weight of responsibility to having sex and having a child because the reality is it's very expensive and time consuming. And unless you have some money saved up and are financially secure or have dual incomes, it's very hard to raise a child living pay check to pay check. I think it's personal responsibility that ultimately decides if you get pregnant. There are kids who have sex but take the precautions and don't get pregnant. If you want to have a lot of sex, go for it, but take the precautions so you don't get pregnant when you don't want to. There are dozens of contraceptives. If you do however have a child, you should pay for the abortion. You made the mistake, so you should pay for the consequences. If you gamble $10,000 at Las Vegas and lose, should the government be responsible for subsidizing that? What do you think people would do in that kind of atmosphere? Don't you think people will gamble money since the risk is subsidized and gamble as much as they can? That's what Fannie Mae did during the 2006-2008 before the recession. The government wanted Fannie Mae to take riskier loans that Fannie deemed to risky to give. The government deemed it unfair and told Fannie that they would guarantee those loans. This took out the risk in the venture and this gave Fannie an opportunity to buy as many subprime loans as possible because it was free money. Even if the people defaulted on it, the gov't would pay the loans back. If the gov't hadn't stepped in and forced Fannie to take those risky loans, Fannie wouldn't have taken them because they would've lost money. The gov't fucked us over and then even worse bailed out the failing banks and corporations on our dime. You let shitty businesses fall. You don't keep investing in it. You need to fix the reasons why you're business is failing because you just throw money into the business."

That seems to be the crux of your argument, and I don't see the distinction.A zygote/fetus has the potential to become a human/person, but that doesn't mean they will. Sperm and eggs have similar potential, but I don't believe you're arguing that they're human. The morning after pill prevents a zygote from implanting - is that a similarly immoral act in your view?The point seems to be on where a separate human life begins, and I think the courts did a good job by saying that it's when a fetus is likely to survive independent of the mother (even with colossal medical resources). Arguing that any combination of sperm and eggs is a human seems overly broad and does not reflect the way society views human life (statistical reporting, birthright citizenship, etc.)."

"t1_dr3trqa"	"VladMolina"	"4"	"I stipulate that you define \\"human being\\" to mean \\"anything with human DNA\\" basically, and I will contest your point #2 that it is always immoral to kill human beings. This is defensible under a number of ethical frameworks. If you're a utilitarian, there is no ethical reason not to kill something that can neither suffer nor wish that it will live in the future, and at some early stages of development at the very least, those things are true of unborn human beings. Under a rights-based approach, its not clear that non-persons should have rights, and you concede that there are plenty of reasons to suggest that some unborn human beings are not persons.Let me address your arguments:;We refer to the zygote/fetus as \\"the child\\", \\"the baby\\", etc... Not \\"it\\" or \\"the zygote\\" or \\"the thing\\".This just transparently has no moral significance, and in fact many people refer to it as \\"the embryo\\" or similar, especially in early stages of development where there is no strong argument for full moral personhood.;A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant woman. Right, and a cute puppy dying brings extra sadness compared to an ugly puppy dying, but that doesn't imply different moral standing. It just proves we're collectively emotional beings whose feelings are not always evidence of deep moral truths.;Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birth.There are many arguments for personhood just a few days before full term that do not hold early in the pregnancy. One doesn't have to defend very late-term or partial-birth abortions in order to defend that some abortions are moral. Also, at this stage, the child can theoretically survive outside the womb without biological obligations to the mother, meaning that abortion is not the only way to protect the woman's right to autonomy over her own body, another potentially important moral difference.;It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.Again, my moral framework would suggest that personhood and moral standing come not in one instant but grow as one develops: the ability to feel pain, the ability to have preferences or hopes for the future, the ability to survive outside the womb, the self-consciousness to wish that one continues to live, all increase one's moral standing. For much of the early stages of development, an embryo or fetus lacks all of these traits."

"t1_dr4e6l5"	"long-lankin"	NA	"A few things - firstly it seems quite absurd to claim you're pro-choice when the apparent conclusion of your beliefs is that abortion is murder. If you find it to be so immoral then I can't really understand how you could support it at all.Secondly, I suggest you look at the work of Mary Anne Warren, among others, who've argued about the justification of abortion through the lack of a foetus' personhood. You seem to have sidestepped their arguments and the issue of personhood on general without considering it. A foetus is not a person, but it gets closer to acquiring such personhood the closer it comes to term. After certain milestones in its development, abortion may be considered immoral - hence why abortion after 24 weeks is restricted, with the only exceptions being if the foetus isn't viable or there's a risk to the mother's life. Before that point the moral worth of the foetus may be outweighed by other considerations - bodily autonomy for instance, as outlined by Judith Jarvis Thomson. Abortions up to 20 weeks occur very rarely, and usually because women haven't had access to it beforehand, or because there is an abnormality with the foetus. You might consider aborting for such reasons to be immoral, but many would consider knowingly inflicting a life of suffering on a child to be a far worse crime. 98% of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks when it is absurd to consider a foetus as anything remotely close to a human life. If there is a moral cost it is so low as to be insignificant, and easily outweighed by the moral right to bodily autonomy etc. Contrary to what you seem to believe, the development of the foetus is actually hugely important to the abortion debate."
"t1_dr4nf6h"	"qdxv"	NA	"&gt; 12 weeks when it is absurd to consider a foetus as anything remotely close to a human lifeA twelve week old foetus looks exactly like a little baby, it is far from absurd and actually quite logical to consider it a human life. It quite clearly has a body and so the pro-life position is the foetus has a right to body autonomy.If the pregnancy risks killing the mother, permanently removing her body autonomy, then it is a moral act to perform an abortion.Aborting during a pregnancy with no complications permanently removes the body autonomy of the foetus, so is morally unacceptable. During pregnancy the body autonomy of the mother is suspended to permanently preserve the body autonomy of another human. It is analogous to being handed a newborn baby (a fully dependent organism) when being airlifted from a sinking ship, you temporarily use your body resources to hold the baby until you reach safety, sacrificing your independence and even risking your stability during the rescue.I see OPs pro-choice position as pragmatic and honest, not at all absurd. Abortion will happen whether he feels it morally defensible or not, so to minimise harm it is legalised and performed under clinical conditions. I feel the same way. Recognising that we end human life during abortion but do it anyway really helps me to understand how we behave as a human society."
"t1_dr76nmi"	"long-lankin"	NA	"I disagree with pretty much everything you have to say I'm afraid. It may look like a small baby, but a foetus at 12 weeks is vastly different physiologically than an actual human infant. Its brain is so underdeveloped that it could be considered brain dead, and it's only after 20 weeks that it begins to have any significant activity at all. It is a potential person, but it is not a person yet. Having a body is not the same thing as having a right to bodily autonomy - you have to have personhood first. Personhood isn't genetic - a fertilised embryo would not be considered by anyone to be anywhere near equivalent to an actual baby. There are physiological milestones instead that must be reached, hence why most agree on a limit of 24 weeks for abortion in most cases. Personhood also has a moral component, requiring the ability to participate to a degree, which is why consciousness, and the ability to learn and interact with the world, as even a baby does, is so essential. Please read what Warren has to say on the subject - at best I can only crudely paraphrase her words and ideas.I don't really agree with the analogy to pregnancy you present at all. For one, I don't regard a foetus and a baby as being in any way morally equivalent, as one possesses personhood while the other does not. Secondly, the nature of the obligation and care required is vast. Caring for a baby for a few hours is in no way the same as surrendering the use of your body for nine months. A better analogy, which actually focuses on bodily autonomy, which you seem to wildly misinterpret, would be the violinist analogy of Thomson."
"t1_dr7ksq6"	"qdxv"	NA	"A twelve week foetus moves and responds to stimuli, it certainly isn't brain dead.This term 'personhood' is problematic. Your criteria for obtaining personhood (participate, learn, interact) excludes people in comas. By losing personhood you then lose the right to body autonomy? Who on Earth makes up these rules?The violin analogy isn't useful because it is a non-consensual scenario, most pregnancies do not result from rape. Pregnancy also does not require you to stay in a hospital bed immobilised for nine months, as in the analogy."
"t1_drbbs7j"	"long-lankin"	NA	"You know, it might help if you actually read what Warren has to say. That way you might not blindly make criticisms that she actually answers beforehand. As for being essentially braindead - I am aware that movement in foetuses can be detected as early as eight weeks. However, levels of brain activity are very low, and most brain development occurs after 20 weeks, particularly after the 24 week mark. This encompasses all higher brain function, including the development of the cerebral cortex, adoption of a sleeping/waking cycle, and so on. IIRC, foetuses begin to respond to music at around 20 weeks. I suppose you could consider it able to respond to stimuli, but at 12 weeks it's ultimately little more than a vegetable. As for the violinist analogy, again it would help if you actually read what Thomson has to say, which you quite clearly haven't. Neither Thomson, nor I, have suggested that it presents an absolute right to abortion in all circumstances, and it very true that it is strongest when arguing for the right to abortion in cases of rape. However, it does help to strengthen the case for the right to an abortion nonetheless, particularly when issues of lack of personhood of the foetus are taken into account. That is a large part of the reason why I don't think abortion of a healthy foetus after 24 weeks is acceptable, unless there is a risk to the mother's welfare. A variant of her argument tackles the issue of the right to abortion when having used contraception, and is referred to as the 'people seed' analogy. It manages to make the point that having taken reasonable steps to prevent pregnancy, you have the reasonable expectation of not getting pregnant, and that the ensuing pregnancy would violate your bodily autonomy. I'm sure you'd regard abstinence as the be all and end all, but even that seems to be making assumptions of safety. What if a woman is raped? If she wanted not to get pregnant then should she have had a hysterectomy? Surely she knew there was a chance she'd be raped, and so should have taken absolute measures to ensure she wouldn't get pregnant as result? While provocative, it does raise the point that abstinence is not necessarily the appropriate measure of the reasonable expectation of bodily autonomy, and that the use of contraception could also be considered as such. I don't think it's quite as strong an argument as that of the violinist analogy, but it does help to assert a more general right to bodily autonomy. Once again, when paired with issues of personhood, I think there's a compelling case to be made for the right to an abortion even in cases outside of rape.As with all the works and authors I've referenced so far, I urge you to actually read it for yourself, something you don't seem to have done up to this point. For what it's worth, I'll point you in the direction of what I consider to be the strongest anti-choice arguments - namely, those of Don Marquis in his famous article \\"Why Abortion is immoral\\", and the central point of the right of a foetus to a \\"future like ours\\"."
"t1_dr5dj4a"	"tropopo"	NA	"While it's not at all absurd to take the stance that a 12-week old foetus seems like human life, it's not very easy to defend that it actually *is* human life. 12-week old foetuses are not conscious and can neither think nor feel, and these are some of the main characteristics that can be used to define being a person. Because of this, it's hard to define them as human so much as something that can eventually *become* human. If your stance then is that it is immoral to disallow something that can become human to do so, that can be extended all the way to fertilized eggs at 0 weeks, which is harder to defend. In that case, I would argue that the only potential moral drawback of terminating a 0-week zygote is that one human that could have potentially existed will not exist, which is exactly the same effect as if the egg had never been fertilized in the first place. Is it then immoral to allow an egg not to be fertilized?"

You are correct that among anti-abortion extremists no abortion is permissible, but among all the rational, reasonable people, and in the courts, everything is about negotiation. Even the anti-abortion extremists are taking this approach when they promote the largely disputed concept of fetal pain. Roe v Wade established the concept of legal abortion until the third trimester. Planned Parenthood v Casey threw out the trimester concept and instead gave the state varying levels of legal regulation of abortion based on fetal viability, generally 23-24 weeks (these are oversimplifications of both cases but I'm trying to keep this brief). Anti-abortion advocates are pushing this debunked concept of \\"fetal pain\\" because it could push abortion restrictions from 24 weeks to 20 weeks. Although the anti-abortion movement would prefer no abortions ever, they are working to achieve their goal through constantly negotiating the rules."

They have more development, self-consciousness, and preferences.A 65 year old and a 20 year old are both self-conscious (in the sense of being aware of their own continuous existence). That is a binary state, either you are or are not in that state, a 65 year old is no more so than a 20 year old. However, at the end of life, somebody with really severe dementia or brain damage might lose that awareness, and my moral values would suggest their their life is no longer of the same moral value that it was when they were fully functional adults, and I find that to be a supporting point to my framework. Likewise, one either is able to form preferences (notably the preference to avoid pain) or they are not; the moral argument is not about how many preferences you have, it is about whether you can form preferences -- again it's a binary state.;Are some disabled people worth less than able-bodied people because they can’t take care of themselves, or their consciousness is limited, or they are unable to make choices for the future? Lets take those one at a time. If a disabled person cannot care for themselves, the question is whether anybody who CAN care for them is willing to. This could include the state for example. In almost any case for a disabled adult, the answer is yes, and this is different in the case of an embryo &lt;24 weeks of development or so whose mother wants an abortion. I think that placing an obligation on an unwilling person is a moral cost that must be weighed against the moral value of the life in question (and the moral value of a life is not automatically either zero or infinite in my system, it has gradients). If somebody is disabled in such a way that they lack awareness of their own existence or they have no preferences, or no conception of the future, then yes I think that makes their life of less moral value than somebody with self-awareness, preferences, and a concept of the future.;Is a diabetic less valuable because they need insulin?No. ;When does someone become worth “a whole person”?Addressed in OP; when they posess all the binary traits mentioned.;If I break/ lose a leg, am I worth 4/5 of everyone else?Obviously not, and I'm beginning to think this is no longer an honest effort to extrapolate from my framework.; I’m not trying to use an emotional argument per se, but doesn’t your standard sound a lot like the denigration of slaves—they weren’t considered as valuable as other people?LOL, this is an absurd and insulting argument.

One can refer to something with the potential to grow into something else as the end result without thinking its there yet. For example, if I referred to a caterpillar as a “butterfly” I would not be indicating I think the caterpillar is in that exact moment the same thing as a butterfly.Many people *also* refer to their pets as “babies” or “children.” This language use does not mean there is consensus that fetus = child.;A pregnant woman getting injured/dying bring extra sadness or outrage from our society than a non-pregnant womanAgain, due to *potential*. In the same way that we’re more outraged when a 15-year-old is murdered than a 60-year-old. At that exact moment the 15-year-old is pretty useless to society, but it’s sad because of what could be accomplished.Incidentally, another example of language use referring to someone’s potential: we’d call that 15-year-olds “young adult” even though we’re well aware that they are not *yet* actually young adults.;Saving \\"the baby\\" at the expense of the mother's life, or the mother dying but giving birth, is a common story element in media (media reflects societal values).You’re right that there’s societal consensus that at *some point* in development, the fetus becomes a child. Particularly if the child can actually be delivered at that point. At that point, you’re 100% correct that most of society would condemn an abortion.But, something like 92% of abortions happen in the first 12 weeks. So without doing a whole asinine “how many grains of sand make a heap” paradox argument (i.e “well it wasn’t that much more developed the day before that, so it was still a child” all the way back), you’re talking about a very small minority of cases.;Most people would be appalled if women were to just get abortions out of convenience a few days before they were due to give birthThat’s true, but again largely meaningless.;It isn't really logical to think that a fetus has no moral value one minute, then the next minute as soon as it is born it now has as much (or even more) moral value than any other person.Sure it is. As with any other development we can stake out a line at which (in the majority of cases) something has changed into something else. In the same way that changes in hue can be incredibly subtle, to the point where going from R:255, G:0, B:0 to R:254, G:0, B:1 is imperceptible. But we can still distinguish red from blue from purple.Vagueness and a lack of a bright line in very close edge cases doesn’t mean we can’t have a bright line that two things are different if they’re miles away from each other.Think about it in statistics:You’re right that the difference between “the minute before birth” and “the minute after birth” in terms of development is very small. Maybe even too small to be significantly differentiated.But the difference between two weeks after conception and the minute before being born is *huge*.Trying to walk it back through the Sorites paradox isn’t logical."

And sure the mother dieing to give birth is in fact a tragic story. Because it is a woman dieing, especially so when she it is a result of a lack of medical access.

It is so much easier to get the abortion earlier. There are inherently greater dangers/costs of late term abortions present compared to ones done early. I do not ascribe any more inherent worth to a late term baby than I do an early term one. It also is kinda a red herring, because as you identified, that isn't the reality.

I believe it's this personhood that makes it truly immoral, not humanity.My point in this isn't that abortion is or is not immoral, but I simply disagree that \\"contains human DNA\\" or \\"if left alone might possibly (miscarriages and such do occur naturally) become a person in the future\\" is enough to make that immoral on its own."

It's immortal to treat someone that way. It's ultimately up to her, and her decision should be *informed* and respected.* Abortion is often just a medical matter. Pregnancy is a complicated biological process and a lot can go wrong, and anti-choice laws take away women's bodily sovereignty. [This podcast](http://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/07/14/podcast-birthright-war-story/) has some cases, including one where a wanted pregnancy nearly killed a woman before the procedure was allowed. It's just not that theoretical and abstract and clean like a philosophy class. It's more like an ER room.My own framing: The mother does not give up sovereignty over her own body when a child starts growing inside her. Whether or not the fetus has rights or is recognized as a full human is irrelevant. It's up to the woman to decide. Guilting her into giving up her body is immoral. It's hers, the child being in there doesn't change that.I think people should be a lot more careful with creating new life than they are. I think the reality of the situation (and I could be wrong) is that men are the ones who are most at fault of not taking the problem seriously, not women. They should stop having sex with women they don't know want and have prepared to have children in a healthy way. (Women should too, but I don't think it's them who are usually pushing for sex. I could be wrong.)I think telling people \don't have sexual intercourse unless both parties want and are prepared for a child\\" is a lot more reasonable than telling women \you have to gestate every child that starts growing inside you, for any reason, or you're a bad person.\\"

No doctor will hesitate to amputate when medically necessary though. I think OP might argue that abortion is much the same way. It is a brutal and necessary fact of life, but it's not something to be treated tritely or to be waved away as \\"all ok\\".

And, being a fertile female, I thought: what would I do? The legal question is, as OP pointed out, rightly a different question from the moral one.I heard the arguments about the violinist. I heard the arguments about how, well, it's a person in there, at least at some point. I learned about when brainwaves are first detectable.And I decided, yeah, if I got pregnant, I wouldn't abort. It would be wrong.I never had to deal with that, even though I made some stupid sexual health decisions, I was very careful not to get pregnant. So some good came of it.But looking back, I'm angry. I *do* feel I was essentially guilted into that position. \\"Think of the child\\". Well what about me?

But much, much more pressing, I think we should stop absolving fathers, and society as a whole of that burden. I think that the issue needs to be beaten in that every abortion which a mother has, every potential life ended, is a failing of a state which allows children and new mothers to go hungry. I would rather hold onto that guilt, and twist it until it it hurts so much that we change how we deal with children for the better. Guilt shouldn't be something which simply weighs on you with no recourse; it should be a motivator to right what is wrong. But instead we treat it as an illness, or a cold, and try to cure a symptom while leaving the cause."

It's also focusing on just one issue in what are often complex situations.Like the mother in the story who died because she did not abort, leaving her young child and family at her death. Because people told her she shouldn't abort and it was murder. If you think guilt is such a great thing to use, then, maybe read it and use it in on yourself in whatever positive way you think guilt should be used on people?Do you see how guilt like this can play out in actual people's lives? That's why I think this approach that anti-choice advocates take is a wrong way to treat people. As you pointed out, there's a lot of other stuff going on, but the narrative is basically all about the woman's guilt. It's \carry the child to term no matter what or you're evil.\\"

"t1_dr5hv3r"	"Commissar_Bolt"	NA	"&gt; That's not true though. There are other reasons women choose not to allow someone to gestate off their body.I think that I have been unclear, and given you a false argument unintentionally. I apologize. I didn't intend to imply that poverty was the only motivator for getting an abortion. I think, however, that you could broadly categorize motivations into three groups: emotional, financial, and medical. ; I would consider this immoral.I would argue that in a choice between two evils, the end of removing the dilemma justifies some immoral means. But that would be a very different discussion. ; Like the mother in the story who died because she did not abort, leaving her young child and family at her death. Because people told her she shouldn't abort and it was murder.I think that this unfairly maligns my argument, because that seems like a clear misattribution of guilt to me. Unless the mother smoked during pregnancy or in some other way caused harm to the process, she should not be considered guilty in the slightest. Grief, naturally. But blaming her in that scenario is unjust. A better party to feel guilt (since we are being theoretical) should be doctors and scientists, who should respectively review their procedures on how to prevent this outcome and determine better ways to mitigate the illness. As an examples in which I think the woman should feel some guilt and benefit from it, let's take a scenario in which a teenager or freshman in college does not use protection (assuming consent, education, etcetera). She opts to get an abortion primarily for financial and emotional reasons: her parents would not accept that she is pregnant and may disavow her, she may be kicked out school, and having a baby would derail her plans of going to medical school entirely. I think it is just for her to feel guilty in getting an abortion. There are selfish reasons mixed in there. Additionally, her parents should also be considered guilty for causing pressure towards an abortion, the father should receive a measure for failing to use protection, and society as a whole is guilty of failing to protect young mothers. Each has varying degrees of guilt, but it is still present. And simply dumping it all on the woman is a misattribution. And a point on this... there are multiple kinds of guilt. Some are healthy - like the kind that lights a fire in your gut and motivates harder and better work. Some are simply crushing, depressing. I would only consider the former useful. The issue I find is with our handling of guilt in general. We misattribute it far too often, and even when we do attribute it correctly we tend to seek punitive measures instead of seeking to help the guilty party make amends."
"t1_dr5iqcr"	"jtown8673877158"	NA	"I don't believe you've understand my central point about guilting, and why it's bad. I believe the people who guilted the women in the story I linked have done something wrong in the way the treated the mother who died. I believe this is basically representative of what the thrust of the entire anti-choice movement is. It's not about the doctors, the scientists, the broader societal issues, whatever. It's about trying to control women's choices about their own bodies by telling them they *have* to surrender their very body to the state's control, whether they want to or not. *That* is the part I'm talking about."

I can just as easily argue that the pro-choice movement should be properly branded pro-abortion or fetus slayers, it makes no difference beyond emotional response. From the perspective of pro-life individuals, the agenda is preventing the murder of unborn children. So instead of continuing to argue semantics, let me ask you this - can you think of a situation in which you would perform an immoral act? Would that inherently weigh on your conscience?

I can just as easily argue that the pro-choice movement should be properly branded pro-abortion or fetus slayers, it makes no difference beyond emotional response.What I'm saying is that I'm not choosing the words for the emotional impact. I'm choosing the words for their *accuracy*. The emotional impact is not a reaction to the words, it's a reaction to the reality I'm pointing to with them.The pro-choice side is *not* pro-abortion. They are not excited about getting more and more abortions to happen. It's pro-bodily-sovereignty, which, yes, sometimes includes killing a child to remove it for the mother. But the *point* is not to kill the child, the point is to not violate the woman's bodily sovereignty.The agenda is not *just* preventing the murder of gestation-age children, it's forcing women to gestate the children against their will to accomplish that goal, because it's the only way the goal can be accomplished. When that's not what's on the line, there is no disagreement between the groups. So it's accurate to call it anti-choice, or if you like pro-forced-gestation.The point I've been arguing is that it's immoral to try to argue from this perspective, that the woman must gestate the fetus against her will. It's her body, end of story, other people around her should be telling her it's her right to make her own choice about her body and answering any questions she has, not expressing their opinions about what she should do with her own body. Talking about how she owes the fetus because otherwise she/he will die is guilting the woman into giving her very body up to do something she doesn't want to do. It's immoral in other situations, and it's immoral here. Do you think the way people treated Emmie in that story I linked was not immoral? That's directly what lead to her death.

And no, nobody stops trying to do good things; I also encourage people to take sex more seriously and carefully. Especially men. We invented birth control and teach people how to use it effectively.Again, very factually: I don't think it's ever right to ask a woman to gestate a child against her will, not even if that fetus will die, and I think it's immoral to try to guilt her into it at all, whether or not her life is in danger, because that's not respecting her bodily sovereignty. I don't think she should feel obligated to carry the pregnancy if she doesn't want to. Yes, it's a life, and yes, she sometimes participated in creating it, but that doesn't mean her body belongs to the new life. And beyond that, laws to give the state control of the woman's body end up harming women in ways that are just silly, like cases of women who couldn't get an abortion procedure even as they were entering sepsis because there was still a heartbeat, or the woman who was imprisoned because she fell down the stairs and people thought she'd tried to miscarry.It just isn't ambiguous to me at all.

But I also feel that it's mistreating me if I get drafted into a war that I don't want to die for. Then again, I don't want my country to lose the war, either. Life throws no-win scenarios at us sometimes. And in my opinion, anytime someone is seriously considering an abortion is one of those. It's not something that should be banned by law or impeded, but it's a stopgap measure until we can find a better way to deal with unwanted pregnancy. Personally, I think that as long as there is a scientific possibility that life begins at conception (which winds up being a matter of opinion) that uncertainty forces us to make the ethical decision of treating a fetus like a human. I can't force that viewpoint on others though. For me, this makes abortion a dilemma, as an immoral but sometimes necessary act."
