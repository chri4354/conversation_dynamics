Any dividing line you come up with is going to be arbitrary and subject to changes in technology or random chance. The only logical point at which to define a pre-born person as a human life is at conception.\\""Logic doesn't come into it. It's a matter of definition, not logic. Any definition is somewhat arbitrary, whether you choose conception, viability, birth, or some other arbitrary dividing line. For example, why is birth so important from a legal perspective? That's a modern assumption. Many if not most human cultures practiced some form of infanticide under certain conditions (malformed infants being perhaps the most common, but also undesirable children or children with undesirable characteristics were frequently abandoned or killed). In many historical cultures, the commission of a crime against an infant was a different sort of offense compared to a child of a certain age who might be able to walk and talk. At some point children were essentially endowed with \\""full human\\"" rights under those legal codes, again under a somewhat arbitrary definition.Of course, it's not completely arbitrary -- any definition makes certain assumptions. The position that you advocate seeks to treat a fertilized egg as a \\""full human,\\"" which may seem most \\""logical\\"" to you, but would have seemed bizarre to perhaps most human cultures throughout history. Viability makes the assumption that what matters is the ability to survive outside the mother. Why is that less arbitrary just because it can change with technology? You seem only to adopt it because it makes your legal conundrum about abortion simpler to deal with, rather than having to handle multiple cases. But that's perhaps the most arbitrary (and illogical) reason for adopting a definition -- not for any reason having to do human values in resolving an ethical conundrum, but just to make your syllogisms easier to resolve??Birth is yet another milestone, though perhaps even more arbitrary than viability given modern medicine that can induce or control the time of birth. And what of the standards of other societies that did not afford full adult rights to infants or even small children? There were rationales for such legal division points too: often the appearance of \\""human\\"" characteristics like walking or talking... or later on the ability to reason (often taken to be around age 7-8). We still have such arbitrary division points to decide legal status: when a person is \\""adult\\"" enough to consent to sex or marriage or various other things, when a person is \\""adult\\"" enough to vote or drink, etc.These all tended to vary historically and thus are cultural rather than logical constraints, though they generally have some broad justification. So, while your method of resolving your argument may be one POSSIBLE logical way of dealing with the issue, it is certainly not the ONLY \\""logical\\"" possibility, depending on the assumptions behind the definition of \\""life\\"" or \\""human rights\\"" or whatever."""	0.15774156153202057	0.41712817549705505	0.4390011429786682

They have historically been against contraception and education, things that help reduce unwanted pregnancies. So it is not children that are important to them.The reason that they are against abortion is not because of love of children. If it was they would be willing to reduce the number of unwanted children and take care of the ones that are born.The reason they are against abortion is that they believe that their holy book, the way they interpret it, gives them the right to dictate to others how they should live. It is as simple as that. It is really class and race warfare. Making it difficult for poor people to control their family size makes keeping them poor easier. It is easy if God says so. The cry about the poor fetuses is not real because if it was they would try to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. It is really about keeping the social order the way it is.it is not unusual to read about a strident anti-abortion family to quietly have their daughter get an abortion.

Abortion is ugly business for everyone. No one likes abortion, it is nasty just thinking about it. The difference is that this block of Christians believe they have the right to dictate for everyone the details of a medical procedure.Why do they believe they have this right? So to be clear my intent is not to insult, although my post was crudely worded. The intent was to show that the real argument is not about when life begins but if a particular interpretation of a holy book gives a voting block the right to impose their moral values on others.That stuff about class and race warfare was unnecessary to my thesis and I take it back. I'm sure that the majority of those who subscribe to anti-choice, sex education and contraception legislation are not consciously doing so out of prejudice against the poor. It has that effect of course but that was not the intent for most people. My implying otherwise was wrong. Thank you for pointing it out.	0.9086297750473022	0.6332026720046997	0.41668304800987244

At conception, not only is there no brain, there aren't even brain cells! You can't be a person without brain cells, or even later on with a brain that is extremely underdeveloped. IMO your argument (the part I quoted) is like saying \\""well, because any age at which you are legally allowed to drink alcohol would be somewhat arbitrary, we will just define it at birth because that is a clear-cut standard.\\"" The truth is there is no exact clear-cut time that personhood begins. Just like there is no exactly clear-cut time we can universally say is appropriate to start drinking alcohol. But with alcohol, we still make our best estimate that has a chance of being right, and go with that. We should do the same thing with development of a fetus. And the real truth is it's more of a spectrum. You aren't not a person at all one day, and then a full person the next. Also, this will be pretty controversial, but people want to \\""play it safe\\"" and avoid slippery slopes by making the cutoff earlier, but IMO we have already done that by assigning full personhood at birth. I mean if a bunch of infants had a rare medical condition where once being born they wouldn't develop any further, and just stay 1 day old, would they really be people? If you look at it without a pro-human species bias, that's a less developed life form than an adult dolphin or elephant or gorilla or crow or whatever. But we play it safe by saying \\""once you are born, you have all the full rights and legal protections of a person.\\"" Now we could still pass some laws about older more developed fetuses, but that's playing it even more safe. To then want to play it safe all the way to conception is massive massive overkill.

42	t1_dj6vi0y	theonijester		Seems simple. Heartbeat means life. If a thirty year old is in the er with no heartbeat they call him dead if they can't revive him. Unless he's a zombie but that in fiction and not relevant. If a heartbeat is detected it means life. Then it must be determined which life is dominant which is the carrier, mother. This means her choice must be most important but she must be informed of all options fully without influence on any of them. Once choice is made all responsibilities mist be known. If aborted then it is simply murder if baby had a heartbeat. If babies life means risk to mothers life then it would mean its self defense.Instead focus should be made on a means to prevent unwanted pregnancies for all men and women. The catch is it gets closer to population control in doing so. But a mandatory drug that stops breeding for both genders without harmful side effects and with an antidote that can be applied for temporary relief would mean less chances of needing abortions. Truth personally is that I only agree with abortion if its to save the mothers life, the child will die regardless such as as birth defect with promising fatality rate of over 90%, or if the child is at risk of killing a twin it has in the womb prior to birth. Children or rape are iffy and harder to speak of. Otherwise I personally don't agree with it but as I will also admit it should be between the mother and father of the child. Father because half the genetic makeup is his. Mother because of the same. If they disagree and mother doesn't want it and father does then she should agree to have it if he pays the bills and fees but she signs all rights as a mother away. Father doesn't want it then he should be forced to sign all rights away. But thats me. Hope I didn't offend anyone.	0.9735541343688965	0.7422817945480347	0.3656865060329437

Since the moderate view is in the middle it is always being polarized and divided by the dogmatic extremes.The dogmatic views are:* the Christian view which fights not only abortion but all forms of birth control because of the dogma of \\human life is sacred\\"" which is defined through religious means and makes no logical sense.* the leftist view that abortion is a right of a woman because whatever is in a woman's body must necessarily fall within the rights of a woman. It is just as dogmatic although there are some logical elements to it, unfortunately the dogma encapsulates the entire argument and it is centered around \\""spiting the conservatives\\"". It is so because it is so and no other considerations are given. In other words it is about the conflict that emerges from abortion which is used to rally people to one camp or another (divide et impera) and not the goal of doing something constructive.

That leads to the conclusion that abortion should be legal because there is not sense in criminalizing an act that has no grounds for criminalization (with some exceptions as always) but it should not be promoted or acted upon unless it is absolutely necessary.

Books on Christian ethics published up until around 1975 were in near universal agreement that ensoulment didn't take place until late in a pregnancy or even at the moment of birth, and that therefore abortion was not a moral issue except for those Evil Catholics (and everyone knows Catholics are't really Christians).It wasn't until the late 1970's that the religious right suddenly switched to believing that abortion was the ultimate evil, and that switch didn't fully complete until the early 1980's.What confuses the matter is that the American right never admitted that it changed its mind, or examined why it did.

Whether the fetus survives out of the womb is a separate question, and should not interfere with a person's rights over her own body. If the fetus is aborted after 8 months, chances are the baby will survive with medical support.Of course, this makes for a more diffucult but also more interesting debate: How far do we go to keep aborted fetuses alive? (Or babies I suppose, once they're out of the womb.) To me, this is hard to answer before we can put a value on human life. For those who don't understand why that is hard: Imagine creating an AI that will work to make life on earth optimal. If you make the AI value quality of life too much, it will kill all humans but those who have good/great quality of life. If you value life itself too much, it will force all women into continuous pregnancies to get as many humans as possible.	0.9929555654525757	0.8706071376800537	0.29946649074554443

119	t1_dj7tms7	faultyproboscus		I'm going to summarize your central thesis before attempting to change your view, if only slightly. You are recognizing here that the abortion debate is currently centered around the idea of personhood. The debate is entirely focused on the point at which fetus crosses the threshold from not-a-person to person. You are also recognizing that this line is somewhat arbitrary and will likely never be fully resolved between different groups of people. I think the comments in this thread so far are evidence to that. You go on to recognize and provide an example that laws are not necessarily there to protect human life above all else. Here you leave off. You seem to be implying that our laws are what they are because of our desires. While this is almost obviously true, it does little to resolve conflicting views of what the law should be. Here we must propose a basis for our laws &amp; society that everyone can agree upon in order to resolve the conflict. No small order.	0.9952834248542786	0.6543412804603577	0.4192570149898529

Equally you would agree that as the baby is being delivered, kicking and screaming, about to have its umbilical cord cut, that is a living breathing human being, yes? So somewhere along the line between the emission of sperm cells and the birth of the child is a point where the developing fetus transitions from being an amorphous developing bundle of cells, into a viable human life capable of sentience, yes?You say the point at which this is defined is arbitrary, I think there's a non-trivial point that you can define this, and its the point at which the nervous system is being finalised and the fetus can react to external stimulus. At this point the foundations of the brain are being cemented, the spinal cord is knitted, and the structure of the nervous system is in place. Typically, this is at the end of the first trimester, somewhere between 22-25 weeks into the pregnancy. And for the record, 91% of abortions take place in the first trimester, before this point. Most people vilify abortion as \\baby murder\\"" because they imagine there must be some vast number of late-term abortions as a regular occurrence, just cutting up a baby as it would be when delivered at birth... but less than 1% of abortions take place in the third trimester, and are only carried out under drastic emergencies because at that point an abortion threatens the life of both mother and child.In which case, should we define human life at this developmental stage of the pregnancy, the vast majority of abortions would remain legal- as for the remain 9%, late term abortions, as I said, are usually only done under dramatic circumstances. The further into the pregnancy you get, the larger and more developed the fetus is, the more dangerous any procedure becomes to both mother and child.

123	t1_dj6wul3	RexDraco	6.0	"There is not only a handful of ways to look at it, but I feel your perspective it's murder is incorrect. Obviously it depends on when you get an abortion, but it can be done as early as three to four weeks while the latest varies between twenty to twenty-four weeks. Week five is when brain development begins among other things. This is the First Trimester and it ends at week eight. At month eight, that is when the brain is developed enough to make connections to the body as well recognize the mother's voice. Even at this time, however, the intelligence of the baby isn't by any means to the level of what we consider human. So the line in the sand probably should be made. *When* is the baby considered human and have human rights? *When* exactly is the flesh inside a woman considered human? If the human life is considered only for humans that have human intelligence, it's fair to have an abortion for the first few months. However, then we need to ask what exactly makes those with various mental illnesses classify as humans with rights, why is also okay to pull the plug on those individuals that don't have a mental illness and at one point very much was healthy but had an accident if they're not awake? Is it murder to pull the plug? Some say yes, some argue it's like abortion and you're ceasing a miserable life that didn't need to come to the world before it started. If we decide where the line in the sand is as well educate everyone how it all works, abortion would no longer be a problem. We all have a line, it's why we don't consider jacking off in the shower as genocide while all those \\lives\\"" go down the drain to never survive. We need to work on that line, what is the difference between something that is a valued life from lets say a plant that exists and is living but is okay to kill, or even animals if it is to eat.

This is just one of many logical ways to look at it, the point is that it doesn't *have* to be murder. The question is, when is it considered different from something we're already comfortable killing? Is it murder to kill a tree? Is it murder to kill ants and roaches?

144	t1_dj6n8oo	YcantweBfrients	1.0	I agree with you that birth is the most reasonable place to draw the line considering where we are at as a society, but I want to take OP's idea even further and explain why I think birth is still of somewhat arbitrary significance. Think about the reasons we don't like to murder children, or let them die. It causes pain, to the parents and the child (depending on how they die). It squanders the potential of a human life. It destroys the knowledge/experiences/memories held by the child's consciousness. I think that's about it? Now, which of these factors changes when a child is born? Perhaps the parents grow more attached to the child when they see its face. The child now has an experience of light and fresh air, and their mother's face (once they open their eyes). Other than that, though, there is no moral obstacle to killing the baby that wasn't there before it was born. It has no memories forming yet, no understanding, barely any consciousness, and the same amount of potential.For this reason, I wonder why we should object to a newborn's parents snuffing out their child's life within the first few minutes it is born (assuming both consent). The reason I think we *do* object, is that we have a visceral negative reaction to death and murder, and an instinct to protect human babies. However, the pain felt would be virtually all the parents', since a newborn is so fragile it would be gone as soon as it was aware of suffering, and the instinct to protect should only be respected in those who intend to raise the child to adulthood. I certainly don't think parents should be allowed to murder their two-year-olds when they decide they've had enough, but I have to think the moment where life becomes precious to someone other than the parents is somewhere after birth.

Some of it is considered benign (killing insects).

In other cases we mostly agree that killing is wrong except for a few hold outs (refusing life-saving treatment to children due to religion beliefs, killing civilians or non-combatants in war). The clear cut cases where basically everyone agrees that killing is wrong are the rarest cases involving murder or genocide or things like that.Note that all the categories are pretty malleable. You can feel free to move the act of abortion through the spectrum of acceptability over the duration of pregnancy. Besides, it's not like a baby receives all of its rights on day 1. There's a similar spectrum of personal autonomy that we bestow on children as well. We don't let them vote or sign contracts or move about freely but in return, we don't expect them to support others through taxes or go to war. Such rights are eased in - and the particular cut-offs may be good or bad.

To them the livelihood of the fetus is greater than the personal freedoms of a parent.If a pro-choice person acknowledges a fetus as being a full human life, it should only be taken as a matter of course to protect that life in accordance with the law.

332	t1_dj7zvxy	MoonGosling		"It's as the saying go (a saying that my father particularly loved): \\Two wrongs don't make a right.\\"" Just because there are people who are gonna kill anyways, that doesn't make it ok to kill.But you can't just decide that life begins at conception either. You said that any dividing line is going to be arbitrary, and this is true to some extent: if we decide that life begins the moment that a spermatozoid has the chance to join an egg, then all sex would be manslaughter, and you'd have to ban it all in exchange for lab-fecundation, where no spermatozoid is wasted. Obviously, this is stupid. The next \\""reasonable\\"" choice would be conception. The moment the spermatozoid joins the egg, then it becomes \\""human-life\\"". This comes *mostly* from a religious stand-point, the idea that that thing is going to become a human being, and thus it's part of god's plan, and thus we shouldn't be able to mess with it. That's not good either, however, because natural abortions happen (aka miscarriages). Well, that fetus hasn't had any choices yet, so you can't say that it died because of it's own doings. The only other option is that it died because of the mother/father's doing. In a case where the parent's didn't cause the abortion by active means (violence, use of forbidden substances), then you'd argue that the fetus' death was a part of god's plan for the parents. In which case god would have killed it perhaps as a lesson to the parents? Why would he allow it to die for no fault of it's own? And why would he allow it to \\""live\\"" if it would never even have a choice to make, and would only cause suffering to the parents? Perhaps, again, because the parents needed something like that? In which case, again, that life would seem to be in service of the other life (in this case, the parents' lives). So this seems like an argument that can't stand on it's own, which causes us to move toward the next \\""reasonable\\"" dividing point: when the fetus has developed enough that it can be considered to be a sentient being (that could be having developed a brain, for instance). This is a less specific dividing line, because defining what makes a creature sentient is somewhat harder in therms of science to specifically say \\""this is the moment\\"". Besides, what level of sentient do we want? If we're talking simply about having complex emotions, then a cow's life should be as valuable as a fetus' life. If it's having what we understand as a conscience, then the deal becomes even more difficult, because, well, scientifically we have no idea of what constitutes conscience, so we can't really pinpoint where it starts (we can't really remember our life in the womb either, so no luck trying to remember when baby's first start to think). So we might finally just say that it's a human life the moment it leaves the womb, when we know it's actually 100% ready as a human life, and there is no doubt left. But then we're done with the whole problem with abortions: if it's a human life only when it's born, then it shouldn't be considered killing a human life while it's still in the womb.Personally, I think the third option is the most reasonable one: science should give it's best estimate as to when the first signs of conscience begins to form (perhaps when all systems needed for it are in place), and that's where the line would be drawn. That would mean that, as we move on this line might change it's position, as more and more is learned about conscience and how it works. This would, then, mean that we might allow abortions that would later be considered illegal, or deny abortions that would later be considered fine. But I think this is better than denying all abortions that should be allowed, or allowing all that might have a reason to be denied. If we needed to have something that would be eternal, then I would go with life beginning the moment the baby is born. As /u/MerrieLee pointed out, people who are a long time in won't just get an abortion on the 8th or 9th month, so there would be a bunch of people who should be allowed to have abortions who would, while most people that would have their abortions denied just simply not abort because of time.P.S.: If we decided that life begins at conception, what would happen if a woman drank and smoked after conception, but before she new she was pregnant? Could that be considered attempted homicide (or even actual homicide, should she actually happen to miscarry?) And speaking of miscarriages, should all miscarriages be considered killing?P.P.S: As I said, the argument for life beginning at conception is *mostly* religious. When it is so, it is flawed in the ways I stated. However, in the cases it's not so (when it's not because every life-form has an inherent right to being alive), then the argument against it goes more in the lines of the more common \\""what's it worth to make sure it's gonna be alive if we don't care about what kind of living conditions it's going to have?\\"" When there isn't a higher power saying that that fetus should be allowed to be born, then we can argue about what is best for the fetus (in a religious debate that's not applicable because only god would know what's best for the baby)."""	0.48229706287384033	0.4769800007343292	0.42620667815208435

The risk is very nearly 100%-the goal is to end the pregnancy.Now I'm pro choice so obviously I don't take the pro life view.

That means that, simply put, fast travel is seen as more important to society than saving a certain number of people. By the same logic it would be fair to say, aborting (killing) x fetuses every year and allowing the women to decide for themselves is beneficial to society as a whole, imho.
