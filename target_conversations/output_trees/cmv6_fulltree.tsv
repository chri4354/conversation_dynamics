11	t1_dgi0id7	bathingcanady		There will never be a way to legally regulate people's ability to reproduce besides incarceration or under serious rehabilitation. Which is why DCS and DFS departments are in place. The trick is convincing people that it's okay to not pass on their genetic material, and to adopt instead of reproducing. If I had been adopted by great parents, my life would've went much differently. The system gives up on a lot of children and returns them to abusive homes. By the way, I'm not usually this depressing. Even I have small joys in life, such as night time car rides, my dogs, and traveling. But most of life's joys require money if everything else around you kind of just sucks.	0.06785619258880615	0.31426671147346497	0.4027506113052368

In no other situation, even when a person is at fault for another person's condition, does the right to life trump someone else's right to bodily autonomy. That is, I make a choice to drive a car, knowing there's a small chance of an accident. If that accident occurs, if someone else is on the verge of death because of my direct choice, that still doesn't give them the right to violate my bodily autonomy, even to save their own life. The mother making a choice to have sex (pregnancy can occur even with protected sex, mind) does not translate into consent to carry a baby, nor does it remove her right to bodily autonomy if she does become pregnant.	0.8883643746376038	0.9135845899581909	0.06291285157203674

28	t1_dghm4qx	CoyotePatronus	11.0	&gt;I do not quite understand your car accident example, would you mind explaining it a bit more?Not at all. The point that was made seems to be that because a woman chooses to indulge in an activity (sex, protected or otherwise) that carries an inherent risk (of pregnancy), that if said risk manifests (she becomes pregnant) she has no choice but to give up her right to bodily autonomy in favor of the fetus's right to life, merely because she is responsible for the fetus being in the situation it's in.Similarly, if I choose to indulge in an activity (car driving) that carries an inherent risk (accidents), if said risk manifests itself and someone else is injured in that accident, whether it's due to my negligence or not- we do not say that I have to give up my bodily autonomy in favor of the injured person's right to life. Say, the car accident damages their liver and they need a transplant to live, and I'm a perfect match. Whether or not I accepted the risks of driving when I got behind the wheel, whether or not I caused the accident and thus the situation this other person is in now, I am not forced to give up my liver to save their life, merely because I am responsible for the situation they are in. Does that help?The car accident scenario takes the argument and demonstrates how, in *other* situations where someone's choices to accept a risk does not translate into a loss of their rights for someone else's benefit if that risk manifests itself. Even if the choice was voluntary. Even if they knew the risks. We do this in *no other scenario*. ;The intrinsic purpose of sex in all forms of animal life is to reproduce.Also to bond and strengthen said bonds, which is why humans have sex even when reproduction is impossible.;...creates an implicit agreement to harbor that life (if conception occurs).Why? Merely because the possible risks are known, even if every precaution is taken to prevent the risk from manifesting? Why is that grounds to to violate someone's right to bodily autonomy in favor of someone else's right to life, when we do so in *no other circumstances*?Why should sex and pregnancy rob a woman of her right to bodily autonomy when this right cannot be taken from her in any other circumstances, even if she were *dead?*Why should a fetus be given a special right (the right to violate someone else's bodily autonomy against their consent) that no one else of any other age or level of development has in any other circumstance?	0.9901520609855652	0.6712185144424438	0.44489148259162903

If you believe in a deity that says murder is bad, it is really that deity that knows the answer to the question. SO in absence of that divine knowledge we are left with science.So here is my opinion. IF i went into an ER with an injury and hooked up to machines, I would be pronounced dead when my heart stopped. Death is the opposite of life so one would assume you are pronounced alive when your heart starts.THere is also the personhood issue. When is a person an person. The first test is really easy. Until a human gives birth to a kitten. puppy or other animal, then my money is on the fact that every human pregnancy will result in a human. The second factor is DNA. Outside of identical twins, DNA is the most foolproof identifier of personhood and of the individual. If two different DNA samples are at a crime scene, we know two people were at the crime scene. If a fetus has a separate DNA from the mother then it is a separate person.

93	t1_dgiv4c6	tenebris_alietum		"&gt; The fetus is a human fetus and should therefore have the right of every other human not to be murdered; everyone should have the opportunity to live.Murder means killing with malice. Abortion isn't legally murder unless it fits the legal definition of malice. Calling abortion murder is deceptive and a bad argument.The problem with the \\everyone should have the opportunity to live\\"" is under certain criteria, such as childhood, constant support and resources from another life is required for that opportunity to exist. So the real statement is \\""Everyone should have the opportunity to live even during the times comes at a great personal cost and sacrifice to someone else.\\"" Is it ethical to produce a life if you cannot afford to provide it the resources it needs to live and no one else is willing to either? ; Many will say that a fetus is not human, yet I would argue that it is because of its genetic makeup. Most people would characterize \\""being human\\"" as exiting the vagina; I disagree. Being human, giraffe, ape, etc., is dependent on one's genetic makeup rather than what it comes out of.Genetics are a program that says what *will* happen, not what *is* happening at moment X. A fetus will turn into a human but is not yet a human.; A fetus 5 months into the pregnancy, for example, if born could very well live and grow into an adult. Yet, that very same fetus could also be aborted. Is abortion killing in this scenario? I believe so.Abortion is killing. Killing is not automatically wrong. If you eat meat or vegetables, you are killing something to survive or directly responsible. You (or your food growers) kill bugs and pests that if they existed, would make you sick and possibly die.; I propose that we compensate the mother for carrying the baby up to natural birth and then put him or her up for adoption.Problem A) Births are not a 100% risk free medical procedure, even in modern societies. Women get damaged and even die through birth. Problem B) This could incentivize people to have children for no other reason than monetary gain. The provider of such money would probably go broke. Probme C) We have environmental problems right now due to the number of people needing resources. I like urban living but look at China with its problems and population density. Do you really want that?; I am alright with abortions under extraordinary circumstances, yet do not think that our culture should be promoting it. Rather, we should promote safe sex and teach respect for the human life that resides in a woman's body.Life is not more or less valuable because it's in the womb or because it's going to become human.

135	t1_dghubdf	hartmatthewd		This is an interesting legal situation because there exist laws in many states that would charge an attacker with murder for the death of a fetus throughout the entire pregnancy: http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx. I (not a lawyer) find this interesting because for a period of time a state would recognize the legality of murder without a self-defense claim.	0.9982962012290955	0.6676473021507263	0.46869659423828125
136	t1_dghircs	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		It wouldn't really be death by negligence. Only to a certain extent does a woman have the ability to control her body.In addition, those who are pro life believe that causing a person's death unintentionally and by complete accident is not morally wrong. It's also not really enforceable or efficient to investigate all miscarriages either.To neglect is in the spectrum of not caring enough to look after something rather than something in the lines of a complete accident.	0.9861749410629272	0.8751765489578247	0.2021360844373703
137	t1_dghj8sh	VortexMagus	3.0	&gt;Only to a certain extent does a woman have the ability to control her body.But there are a large number of things you can do to avoid miscarriage, or minimize the trouble. You could see a fertility doctor, take fertility drugs, reduce stress, not consume recreational drugs or alcohol, etc. If a woman doesn't do these things, she is greatly increasing the risk of miscarriage and thus, dead babies. Just as you wish to render the number of dead babies from abortion to nearly zero by making it illegal to abort them, we could reduce the number of dead babies from miscarriage to nearly zero by making it illegal for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, we could simply have all our babies birthed from test tubes and have a nearly zero rate of miscarriage. Easy, efficient, simple, no more dead babies. Further bonus that no more women who are harmed or ravaged by pregnancy, which is a very taxing and difficult process!---Or you could just concede that a microscopic cell inside a woman may or may not see fruition as an actual living person, and is not entitled to all the rights and responsibilities thereof, at which point all of this debate becomes moot. The real key to the abortion debate is where we define life to start, and I think any medical professional who has really studied the science and process of pregnancy will know that it doesn't start with the sperm and the egg uniting - there's too many factors involved that make this definition super shaky and inconsistent. Zygotes die all the time for any number of reasons (abortion being only a very tiny percentage of them).	0.9975709319114685	0.6666536927223206	0.4652967154979706
138	t1_dghjxzk	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		All actions have risks of killing other people either way though, would that mean that everyone should just stay indoors at all times and never drive cars? That's quite absurd. It would be great to keep track of all those things like how irresponsible it is to drink while pregnant, etc, but no one would be able to enforce it (like cheating on your spouse).I would have to argue that the debate on where personhood begins would be is kind of moot. You can refer to Sorites paradoxes. For example, if were to say that moment of personhood or life begins at 23 weeks, would that mean that a 22 week, 6 days, 23 hour old fetus wouldn't have the right to life? Seems kind of arbitrary.	0.18047812581062317	0.2051464319229126	0.06083624064922333

Seems kind of arbitrary.Exactly. Meanwhile, you suggest that personhood begins right when the sperm hits the egg, a moment thats impossible to measure, that happens many times without anybody even knowing about it, and which may die without anybody even knowing about it. Seems even more arbitrary than 23 weeks in to me - at least 23 weeks in we can see the baby's organs develop and we know its probably not going to die.	0.008100626990199089	0.21643565595149994	0.2991601526737213
140	t1_dghkjqq	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		The moment of conception may be impossible to measure. However, it basically would mean that the fetus would essentially be a person in all steps of development after conception, which would not require complex arbitrary rules that would have to essentially break down to compare how many cells or type of cells the fetus is lacking.Yes, the fetus could die due to unfortunate circumstances, but since those unintentional deaths couldn't really been soundly prevented, it would be inculpable.	0.8153191804885864	0.6839475631713867	0.195693239569664
141	t1_dghmagq	VortexMagus	3.0	&gt;Yes, the fetus could die due to unfortunate circumstances, but since those unintentional deaths couldn't really been soundly prevented, it would be inculpable.They *could* have been prevented, though. There are many ways to reduce or mitigate the effects of miscarriage entirely. For example, we could ban all women from drinking alcohol, doing recreational drugs, force them all to go to a fertility doctor, reduce their stress levels, or simply just ban pregnancy entirely and have all our babies out of test tubes. Miscarriage solved, easy as pie.	0.6171689629554749	0.5591061115264893	0.32506057620048523
142	t1_dghong1	thecakeisalieeeeeeee		Even though that those might reduce the chance of miscarriage, miscarriage can still happen due to random chance.

143	t1_dghh4ri	TelicAstraeus	1.0	This is the thing that gets me with people who are pro-abortion, (or pro-choice)... it's up to a personal estimation of when a fetus is alive or deserving of life. Doctor X says Z amount of weeks and the fetus can live on its own without support. Doctor Y says Q amount of months. etc. Which expert is right? Will they be saying the same thing tomorrow?Can an infant live on its own without support?I think there's a moral responsibility as soon as fertilization happens to do everything possible to see the new life gets what it needs to become a healthy functioning member of society. If one is to draw an arbitrary imaginary temporal line in the sand, before which the life is free to be discarded... that seems unnecessarily evil to me.	0.3240373730659485	0.43561285734176636	0.3970533013343811

146	t1_dghja9n	Waphlez		The way I see it is the amount of people that actually get to exist is a tiny tiny sliver of the amount of potential humans that will never get to exist. Aborting before the fetus attains consciousness, to me is almost indistinguishable from the potential child not existing in the first place. But you would never accuse someone choosing not to have children of something equivalent of murder. If you think drawing the line of personhood at human consciousness is arbitrary, drawing the line at moment of conception is arguably arbitrary as well, unless you invoke the beleif in souls (which I'm not saying you are, but it is the most common. Argument), but then you start delving into prrsonal beliefs rather than something objective for society to make laes around. But you are right, the question isn't easy, but there are also concerns of the rights of the mother, which are immediately denied if you draw the line at conception. Without a compelling reason to draw the line at conception , you are potentially causing a lot of unnecessary harm.	0.5406075119972229	0.5006524324417114	0.44545087218284607
147	t1_dghjs1g	NowTimeDothWasteMe	4.0	"&gt;Can an infant live on its own without supportI think the biggest difference is that an infancy can be supported *without* causing physical harm to its supporter. They don't have to drain any physical nutrients from another human being to survive. A fetus cannot do that. It is parasitically reliant on mom to provide nutrients, oxygen, blood, etc. and does so by causing physical harm. Pregnancy increases the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, clotting issues, musculoskeletal pains - all of which can lead to dangerous health effects down the road. So if we say that mom should be required to donate her body to help support her innocent fetus, then where does that line stop? Should dad be required to donate his blood to his one year old? What about his thirteen year old? What about his bone marrow? What about a kidney? And even if it is his moral responsibility to do that so his child can be a \\healthy functioning member of society\\"" should the government be allowed to mandate that morality?"""	0.7839932441711426	0.5595215559005737	0.4582664966583252
