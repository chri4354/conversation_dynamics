"t1_dgi4r87"	"aleph473"	"9"	"&gt;The fetus is a human fetus and should therefore have the right of every other human not to be murdered; everyone should have the opportunity to live.It's a \\"human\\", but is it really a person? It has no thoughts, no emotions, no identity, no feelings, no subjective experience of the world, and no capacity to experience an interest in continuing its own existence. If it's wrong to kill a \\"fetus\\" because a fetus is a person, then what makes it okay to kill, say, cows? Cows are certainly more intelligent than fetuses. ;In this case, I propose that we compensate the mother for carrying the baby up to natural birth and then put him or her up for adoption.With two million abortions occurring per year, and with the cost of carrying a pregnancy to term and delivering being in the tens of thousands of dollars, who's going to pay for this? ;I would like to clarify something: killing a fetus is wrong because it has the potential to become a person. Four out of five fertilized eggs will either fail to implant or otherwise not result in a viable birth. By your definition, there are \\"potential persons\\" whose lives have value, and therefore it would follow that we must protect their lives. This would entail, for instance, forcing any woman who has not been sterilized to constantly be taking fertility drugs to ensure that the \\"potential persons\\" reach term. Or it would conversely imply that we should forcibly sterilize people in order to prevent the creation of doomed \\"potential persons\\". And when does something become a \\"potential person\\"? Is a sperm or an egg cell a potential person? What makes an egg cell or a sperm cell not a potential person?"
"t1_dghhtl8"	"SchiferlED"	"13"	"&gt;The fetus is a human fetus and should therefore have the right of every other human not to be murdered; everyone should have the opportunity to live.It has the right to live, but not the right to be inside of the woman when she doesn't want it inside her. If the natural result of removing it from her body is the death of the fetus, then that is just an unfortunate circumstance, not murder. \\"Right to live\\" does not mean \\"everything possible must be done to keep it alive, or else it's murder\\".;Many will say that a fetus is not human, yet I would argue that it is because of its genetic makeup. Most people would characterize \\"being human\\" as exiting the vagina; I disagree. Being human, giraffe, ape, etc., is dependent on one's genetic makeup rather than what it comes out of.Human genetics is not the issue here. If anything \\"personhood\\" is the issue, although that still does not get around my first point. The skin on your back is \\"human\\" but you don't bat an eye at someone who scratches their back and kills human cells. That's because those cells alone are not a \\"person\\". Many argue that the fetus is not developed enough to be a \\"person\\" yet, so there is no issue with an abortion."
"t1_dghj7ja"	"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	NA	"&gt;If the natural result of removing it from her body is the death of the fetus, then that is just an unfortunate circumstance, not murder. A pro lifer would argue that this would be the equivalent of killing a person to quicken the cure of a temporary illness that they have. With that logic, you could say that killing the person in desperation is a natural response to survival and their death is an unfortunate circumstance.They usually value life over an amount of suffering."
"t1_dghkioc"	"SchiferlED"	"13"	"I don't see this as a valid comparison. In that situation the person being killed is not reliant on the other person remaining in the sickened state to sustain its life.

"t1_dghliit"	"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	NA	"I would have to argue that the violinist argument is not really a good analogy for this scenario at all. It would be along if the lines of a person suddenly appearing in front of you and is connected to your body. But in that case where you have no choice other than to suffer through or killing a person to escape before they get cured by using your blood.A persons bodily autonomy would be conserved in the organ scenario, since they did not really consent to giving up their organs. They have no obligation to do so. But I do question those scenarios. For example, if scientists found out that your blood can cure all diseases, could just as easily prevent the advancement of humanity in the name of bodily autonomy as well?"

It is my blood, after all. It would be a good and altruistic act to give my blood to others, but it does not mean I'm a bad person if I don't give it.

"t1_dghk1mv"	"CoyotePatronus"	"11"	"&gt;Therefore, the baby has the right to be inside of the mother.No. It doesn't matter if the situation is of the mother's direct cause. In no other situation, even when a person is at fault for another person's condition, does the right to life trump someone else's right to bodily autonomy. That is, I make a choice to drive a car, knowing there's a small chance of an accident. If that accident occurs, if someone else is on the verge of death because of my direct choice, that still doesn't give them the right to violate my bodily autonomy, even to save their own life. The mother making a choice to have sex (pregnancy can occur even with protected sex, mind) does not translate into consent to carry a baby, nor does it remove her right to bodily autonomy if she does become pregnant."
"t1_dghkcmw"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"I do not quite understand your car accident example; would you mind explaining it a bit more? The intrinsic purpose of sex in all forms of animal life is to reproduce; engaging in the act whose purpose is to create life, in my opinion, creates an implicit agreement to harbor that life (if conception occurs)."

"t1_dghm4qx"	"CoyotePatronus"	"11"	"&gt;I do not quite understand your car accident example, would you mind explaining it a bit more?Not at all. The point that was made seems to be that because a woman chooses to indulge in an activity (sex, protected or otherwise) that carries an inherent risk (of pregnancy), that if said risk manifests (she becomes pregnant) she has no choice but to give up her right to bodily autonomy in favor of the fetus's right to life, merely because she is responsible for the fetus being in the situation it's in.Similarly, if I choose to indulge in an activity (car driving) that carries an inherent risk (accidents), if said risk manifests itself and someone else is injured in that accident, whether it's due to my negligence or not- we do not say that I have to give up my bodily autonomy in favor of the injured person's right to life. Say, the car accident damages their liver and they need a transplant to live, and I'm a perfect match. Whether or not I accepted the risks of driving when I got behind the wheel, whether or not I caused the accident and thus the situation this other person is in now, I am not forced to give up my liver to save their life, merely because I am responsible for the situation they are in. Does that help?The car accident scenario takes the argument and demonstrates how, in *other* situations where someone's choices to accept a risk does not translate into a loss of their rights for someone else's benefit if that risk manifests itself. Even if the choice was voluntary. Even if they knew the risks. We do this in *no other scenario*. ;The intrinsic purpose of sex in all forms of animal life is to reproduce.Also to bond and strengthen said bonds, which is why humans have sex even when reproduction is impossible.;...creates an implicit agreement to harbor that life (if conception occurs).Why? Merely because the possible risks are known, even if every precaution is taken to prevent the risk from manifesting? Why is that grounds to to violate someone's right to bodily autonomy in favor of someone else's right to life, when we do so in *no other circumstances*?Why should sex and pregnancy rob a woman of her right to bodily autonomy when this right cannot be taken from her in any other circumstances, even if she were *dead?*Why should a fetus be given a special right (the right to violate someone else's bodily autonomy against their consent) that no one else of any other age or level of development has in any other circumstance?"

Death is the opposite of life so one would assume you are pronounced alive when your heart starts.THere is also the personhood issue. When is a person an person. The first test is really easy. Until a human gives birth to a kitten. puppy or other animal, then my money is on the fact that every human pregnancy will result in a human. The second factor is DNA. Outside of identical twins, DNA is the most foolproof identifier of personhood and of the individual. If two different DNA samples are at a crime scene, we know two people were at the crime scene.

If society really was pro-life, society would ensure there is no poverty, no war, no people going broke because they can't afford medical care, and that everyone has the resources they need to live. It doesn't, so it's inherently hypocritical and dishonest in this regard if it adopts a pro-life position as understood by popular conservative ideology. To me, the whole pro-life position is really a pro-birth, and there are obvious motivations for ruling classes to simply have an excess of people at disposal and easily manipulable due to being desperate due to poverty or resource starvation.

"t1_dghg2c3"	"Sensei2006"	"2"	"At what point in the development cycle do you believe a fetus becomes entitled to human rights? At the moment of conception, or some point later in the process?"
"t1_dghgusp"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"I currently view conception as being the moment that a human is created"
"t1_dghh5pm"	"Waphlez"	NA	"Why Do you find that moment so important? Surely what makes a human is one's conscience, no?"
"t1_dghhd4d"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"I used to think that, but now have shifted my view on the subject. Take severely mentally challenged people; I once knew a child with half a brain-- zero mental capacity-- yet he still was and is considered to be a human being. Viewing conscience as what makes a human a human, we would then also be allowing the killing of young children (0-1 year old) who have no conscience whatsoever."
"t1_dghhyyo"	"Waphlez"	NA	"0-12 month olds absolutely have conscience. I don't really think you can compare people already born as the same as a zygote. Also how do feel about the option to pull life support on the clinically braindead?Edit: I realized I said conscience, I meant conscious in this discussion."
"t1_dghjmx5"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"How is a one week old child different from a mid term fetus in terms of practical cerebral faculties?I am in favor of pulling life support off of the clinically brain dead as they will never regain the potential to be 'alive'. A fetus will become conscious, on the other hand."
"t1_dghi9uj"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; Take severely mentally challenged peopleThat's a different situation. Those people do not exist as beings physically attached to one specific person's blood stream and nutrients system through an umbilical cord, usurping that person's bodily nutrients and energy for its own. A fetus does. So a fetus lacks consciousness, not knowing it exists and won't be able to know when it no longer exists, *and* is it usurping one specific woman's bodily resources and energy when she wants to stop that."
"t1_dghjp8x"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"I agree; what I was trying to exemplify is that consciousness does not equate to personhood."
"t1_dghhc3i"	"VortexMagus"	"3"	"One of the reasons that many people (including me) do not share this view with you is that in the process of pregnancy, there are many things that can stop a zygote (the united cell of a sperm and an egg) from maturing. Obstetricians estimate that miscarriage (medical term: spontaneous abortion) happens in [approximately 50% of pregnancies](http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/pregnancy-miscarriage), almost always in the first trimester, usually without the woman even having knowledge that she was pregnant.If we assume that abortion is the killing of a baby, then we must also assume that miscarriage is the death of a baby. It would be inconsistent to claim that abortion is murder without the issue of miscarriage being involuntary manslaughter or death by negligence."
"t1_dghjspm"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"Yes, I would agree that a miscarriage is, technically speaking, the death of a baby. Considering the uniqueness of abortion, I am certain that laws could be put in place to prevent charges such as manslaughter from being raised."
"t1_dghvjzl"	"aguafiestas"	"11"	"If you believe that a human zygote is a Human with a capital H and all the moral weight that carries, then spontaneous early miscarriage is by far the most common cause of death in the world, accounting for at least half of all deaths. What's even worse is that these are deaths at the very beginning of life, leading to the most lost \\"life-years.\\" How much money should we as a society be investing in preventing these deaths? After all, you're talking about far more deaths than something like cancer or malaria. Is the answer hundreds of billions of dollars each year? If not, why not?Furthermore, how do you feel about IVF? IVF involves fertilizations in a test tube that produce zygotes - *Humans* - that will never go beyond that stage. Is this immoral? Is it mass homicide to unplug a freezer full of unwanted embryos?"
"t1_dghw28p"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"!delta reading this made me realize that preventing abortion is logically not the best option. In a way, my principal objection to abortion was emotional rather than objectively logical. Thanks"

"t1_dghubdf"	"hartmatthewd"	NA	"This is an interesting legal situation because there exist laws in many states that would charge an attacker with murder for the death of a fetus throughout the entire pregnancy: http://www.ncsl.org/research/health/fetal-homicide-state-laws.aspx. I (not a lawyer) find this interesting because for a period of time a state would recognize the legality of murder without a self-defense claim."
"t1_dghircs"	"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	NA	"It wouldn't really be death by negligence. Only to a certain extent does a woman have the ability to control her body.In addition, those who are pro life believe that causing a person's death unintentionally and by complete accident is not morally wrong. It's also not really enforceable or efficient to investigate all miscarriages either.To neglect is in the spectrum of not caring enough to look after something rather than something in the lines of a complete accident."
"t1_dghj8sh"	"VortexMagus"	"3"	"&gt;Only to a certain extent does a woman have the ability to control her body.But there are a large number of things you can do to avoid miscarriage, or minimize the trouble. You could see a fertility doctor, take fertility drugs, reduce stress, not consume recreational drugs or alcohol, etc. If a woman doesn't do these things, she is greatly increasing the risk of miscarriage and thus, dead babies. Just as you wish to render the number of dead babies from abortion to nearly zero by making it illegal to abort them, we could reduce the number of dead babies from miscarriage to nearly zero by making it illegal for a woman to get pregnant. Instead, we could simply have all our babies birthed from test tubes and have a nearly zero rate of miscarriage. Easy, efficient, simple, no more dead babies. Further bonus that no more women who are harmed or ravaged by pregnancy, which is a very taxing and difficult process!---Or you could just concede that a microscopic cell inside a woman may or may not see fruition as an actual living person, and is not entitled to all the rights and responsibilities thereof, at which point all of this debate becomes moot. The real key to the abortion debate is where we define life to start, and I think any medical professional who has really studied the science and process of pregnancy will know that it doesn't start with the sperm and the egg uniting - there's too many factors involved that make this definition super shaky and inconsistent. Zygotes die all the time for any number of reasons (abortion being only a very tiny percentage of them)."
"t1_dghjxzk"	"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	NA	"All actions have risks of killing other people either way though, would that mean that everyone should just stay indoors at all times and never drive cars? That's quite absurd. It would be great to keep track of all those things like how irresponsible it is to drink while pregnant, etc, but no one would be able to enforce it (like cheating on your spouse).I would have to argue that the debate on where personhood begins would be is kind of moot. You can refer to Sorites paradoxes. For example, if were to say that moment of personhood or life begins at 23 weeks, would that mean that a 22 week, 6 days, 23 hour old fetus wouldn't have the right to life? Seems kind of arbitrary."
"t1_dghk4u5"	"VortexMagus"	"3"	"&gt;For example, if were to say that moment of personhood or life begins at 23 weeks, would that mean that a 22 week, 6 days, 23 hour old fetus wouldn't have the right to life? Seems kind of arbitrary.Exactly. Meanwhile, you suggest that personhood begins right when the sperm hits the egg, a moment thats impossible to measure, that happens many times without anybody even knowing about it, and which may die without anybody even knowing about it. Seems even more arbitrary than 23 weeks in to me - at least 23 weeks in we can see the baby's organs develop and we know its probably not going to die."
"t1_dghkjqq"	"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	NA	"The moment of conception may be impossible to measure. However, it basically would mean that the fetus would essentially be a person in all steps of development after conception, which would not require complex arbitrary rules that would have to essentially break down to compare how many cells or type of cells the fetus is lacking.Yes, the fetus could die due to unfortunate circumstances, but since those unintentional deaths couldn't really been soundly prevented, it would be inculpable."
"t1_dghmagq"	"VortexMagus"	"3"	"&gt;Yes, the fetus could die due to unfortunate circumstances, but since those unintentional deaths couldn't really been soundly prevented, it would be inculpable.They *could* have been prevented, though. There are many ways to reduce or mitigate the effects of miscarriage entirely. For example, we could ban all women from drinking alcohol, doing recreational drugs, force them all to go to a fertility doctor, reduce their stress levels, or simply just ban pregnancy entirely and have all our babies out of test tubes. Miscarriage solved, easy as pie."
"t1_dghong1"	"thecakeisalieeeeeeee"	NA	"Even though that those might reduce the chance of miscarriage, miscarriage can still happen due to random chance. We still don't fully know why miscarriages happen either, so I wouldn't say that it is just solved just like that."
"t1_dghh4ri"	"TelicAstraeus"	"1"	"This is the thing that gets me with people who are pro-abortion, (or pro-choice)... it's up to a personal estimation of when a fetus is alive or deserving of life. Doctor X says Z amount of weeks and the fetus can live on its own without support. Doctor Y says Q amount of months. etc. Which expert is right? Will they be saying the same thing tomorrow?Can an infant live on its own without support?I think there's a moral responsibility as soon as fertilization happens to do everything possible to see the new life gets what it needs to become a healthy functioning member of society. If one is to draw an arbitrary imaginary temporal line in the sand, before which the life is free to be discarded... that seems unnecessarily evil to me."
"t1_dghhfk7"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"Very well said :)"
"t1_dghi30a"	"TelicAstraeus"	"1"	"Thanks. I'm not sure it's the strongest argument, but its what I've got for the moment. It's what *seems* to satisfy through logos what my instinct screams at me is right."
"t1_dghja9n"	"Waphlez"	NA	"The way I see it is the amount of people that actually get to exist is a tiny tiny sliver of the amount of potential humans that will never get to exist. Aborting before the fetus attains consciousness, to me is almost indistinguishable from the potential child not existing in the first place. But you would never accuse someone choosing not to have children of something equivalent of murder. If you think drawing the line of personhood at human consciousness is arbitrary, drawing the line at moment of conception is arguably arbitrary as well, unless you invoke the beleif in souls (which I'm not saying you are, but it is the most common. Argument), but then you start delving into prrsonal beliefs rather than something objective for society to make laes around. But you are right, the question isn't easy, but there are also concerns of the rights of the mother, which are immediately denied if you draw the line at conception. Without a compelling reason to draw the line at conception , you are potentially causing a lot of unnecessary harm."
"t1_dghjs1g"	"NowTimeDothWasteMe"	"4"	"&gt;Can an infant live on its own without supportI think the biggest difference is that an infancy can be supported *without* causing physical harm to its supporter. They don't have to drain any physical nutrients from another human being to survive. A fetus cannot do that. It is parasitically reliant on mom to provide nutrients, oxygen, blood, etc. and does so by causing physical harm. Pregnancy increases the risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, clotting issues, musculoskeletal pains - all of which can lead to dangerous health effects down the road. So if we say that mom should be required to donate her body to help support her innocent fetus, then where does that line stop? Should dad be required to donate his blood to his one year old? What about his thirteen year old? What about his bone marrow? What about a kidney? And even if it is his moral responsibility to do that so his child can be a \\"healthy functioning member of society\\" should the government be allowed to mandate that morality?"
"t1_dghieag"	"[deleted]"	NA	"&gt; to see the new life gets what it needs to become a healthy functioning member of societyIt seems you're not drawing an arbitrary line as to when that *ends.* We as a society don't do everything possible to see that all newborn infants become healthy functioning member of society. Not newborn infants, not toddlers, children, teens, adults... only fetuses? At the direct expense of women? Taking away women's ability to be healthy functioning adults to temporarily enslave them to any fetuses they happen to get pregnant with?"
"t1_dghkfsc"	"Reason_is_Key"	NA	"I would say that we do try to ensure that all humans become healthy functioning members of society. Why do we have a public educational system then?"
