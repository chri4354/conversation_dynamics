0	t3_5ri7y5	awolz	2.0	First, a clarification: I am undecided as to whether abortion is morally right or wrong. I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.One argument that is very prevalent on the pro-choice side of the debate is in regards to how the situation of the woman affects the extent to which abortion is morally justifiable. They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception. A raped woman is simply choosing to leave a situation (pregnancy) that she has not, in any conceivable way, consented to; she has the *right* to do this.But how can this possibly change the morality of the **act** of abortion? On one operating table there is a woman who has been raped, and on another there is an apathetic woman who has regular unprotected sex. They both undergo the same procedure - on both operating tables the immediate consequences are *exactly* the same - so how can one of these procedures be considered significantly more moral than the other? The thought that the righteousness of an abortion should be judged on personal context, and not just the development of the fetus, seems nonsensical to me; the **act** of terminating a pregnancy must either be deemed moral or immoral by a society, regardless of personal circumstance.Change my view! I've flip-flopped about abortion many times before.EDIT: I believe that an abortion that saves the mother is morally justifiable, and this is the only contextual clarification that I think needs to exist. That's because an abortion that saves the mother's life and an abortion in which the mother will be healthy regardless are different in a quantifiable, measurable way.EDIT2: A situation where the mother's mental deterioration is likely to cause suicide, if she continues with the pregnancy, would also justify abortion for the same reasons as in the original edit. _____; *This is a footnote from the CMV moderators.

2	t1_dd7v0nd	Nucaranlaeg	1.0	My understanding is that it's a compromise tactic - if we agree that personal autonomy is desirable, we can say that a woman has surrendered a certain portion of her autonomy by having sex. As a woman who is raped cannot be said to have surrendered that portion of her autonomy, it's *easier* to make a case that abortion should be permissible in that situation. If pro-life people must cede some area, that's the most difficult to keep in any case. The morality of it is unchanged.	0.043048009276390076	0.06715043634176254	0.07198262959718704

I am able to rationalise both sides of the debate and understand the perspectives that they approach from, but both sides have thus far failed to convince me. I hope that I will be able to form a conclusive view on the issue, and this is one step towards that.Morality is a concept used by autonomous entities to dictate their choice between various available actions. For example, a government would use morality in order to determine whether or not to pass a law. If X welfare act is passed it will save 150,000 lives, while the cost only comes out of the rich that have so much money they could never hope to spend it all in their lifetime. The question is, what is the guideline by which morality determines the best action? The answered by looking at the factors that apply to morality: namely sentience and autonomy. Sentience is the ability to feel pain, undergo suffering; and to feel pleasure. In short, undergo positive and negative mental states. If an entity does not possess either of these qualities, moral theory does not apply. For example, what is an immoral action you could do to a rock? It does not feel pain or pleasure, and does not have the consciousness to realize its own will. Autonomous beings must take into account the overall pleasure and suffering created by an action, as well as the limits to the autonomy of beings. Although confining someone in a room against their will doesn't cause them any pain, their autonomy is violated because they do not wish to be confined. But, if confining them against their will prevents a greater suffering, for example if a criminal was released it would lead to the deaths or injury of any number of people. Thus, confining a criminal is just. In short, moral theory is made up of the ratio of pleasure to suffering created by an action. In the case of an abortion, the fetus does not feel pain at 24 weeks. At this point in the life of a fetus the fetus has the consciousness of a worm, and cannot realize its own autonomy. What moral properties does it possess that could dictate whether an action against it would be immoral? None exists. There is nothing immoral you can do to something that doesn't feel pain and isn't conscious. Thinking otherwise is antilogic and antireality.

5	t1_dd7hpz2	hamataro	6.0	"I think what you're criticizing is people judging how \\responsible\\"" the woman is, and I do agree that seems unjustified. It ignores the actual consequences of the act of abortion, and tries to make it about the character of individuals rather than answering the big questions. However, the context of a pregnancy still matters. A common framework for making moral choices is utilitarianism, the principle of making the choice that will cause the most good, or cause the least harm. So long as we see the abortion of a fetus as a moral harm, no matter how great or how small, the question of whether it is justified depends on the alternative. Some religious people, for example, see the fetus as being identical to a human being, and no matter how harmful the alternative is, they will never see abortion as justified. Others think that a fetus is not fundamentally different from other internal organs, and consider abortion to be justified in almost all cases, even if the alternative isn't particularly bad. Because the alternative is carrying the pregnancy to term, abortion has to be morally evaluated against how harmful completing the pregnancy would be. For women who were raped, this can be a traumatic, emotional, and humiliating experience. Because of how painful that would be, abortion is more justified in her case than in some other cases. Not because of her purity, or her being a more responsible person than others, but because to her, not getting an abortion would cause so much pain."""	0.11709938198328018	0.4274646043777466	0.43512508273124695
6	t1_dd8kkb4	kazuyaminegishi	2.0	&gt; They may argue, for instance, that as a woman who has been raped has made no decision to risk initiating a pregnancy they should immediately have access to an abortion. This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception.As far as I understand the prime argument for Pro-Choice is that the woman should be able to choose what she does with her body period. She is the one responsible for feeding the embryo for 9 months and eventually birthing it into this world, the man only provides insemination.My biggest issue with this statement however comes from the part where you imply that women who aren't raped but choose to get an abortion are using it as a contraceptive. I think this is MAYBE true in a number of women so small it shouldn't even be considered.The primary reason for getting an abortion would be health concerns, which you've said you think is morally justifiable (this is a hard metric to judge anything on since your morals can vary wildly from someone else's).Secondary could be financial, it is significantly more cost effective for society for a mother who cannot afford a child to get an abortion than it is for her to place that child into the adoption system. Abortion offers a method of population control that becomes vitally important the larger humanity's population grows.And the last could be circumstances of the pregnancy. Your argument seems to be hinged around this where you believe that even if the circumstances are out of a woman's control she still is morally wrong to kill the fetus, others have pointed out that having the child of your rapist could be mentally trying for a mother and lead to suicide (or even abuse of the child). I'd also point out that sometimes these children could be unplanned and that could lead back into financial reasoning for abortions.When it comes down to morality the question really boils down to what you consider an embryo to be. If you think that a woman is carrying a human at this point then it would be difficult to coax you into the belief that there is no black morality involved with abortion. For me personally, embryo aren't human yet, at that point in their life they are extremely close to parasites. They cannot survive without the mother's influence so the mother should be given right to choose what to do with something that uses her own bodily resources to sustain itself.	0.9979696869850159	0.8731278777122498	0.2548837959766388

If the fetus is regarded as having the same moral properties as a human being, then a raped women could not have a child. The raped woman would be valuing her own autonomy over the life of the fetus. Think about moral rights, in the Dec of Indep., every being has an intrinsic right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. This is hirearchical. One cannot have liberty with life, or pursue their happiness without liberty. Life is always greater than liberty, and liberty greater than pursuit of happiness. Violating a right to life to preserve a right to autonomy is unjust. That is only if you accept that a literal fetus with the same properties of a worm is valued over a victim of sexual assault.

10	t1_dd7g6m4	Amablue	91.0	Consider the following two scenarios:1. A driver maliciously runs over someone they hate, an ex perhaps, killing them. 2. A driver loses control of their car striking a pedestrian, killing them. Both of these situations in the abstract are very similar. A person behind the wheel of a car kills a person. However, that does not mean we treat these cases the same when they go to court. While the first driver will almost certainly go to jail, the second one may not. Despite being in essentially the same action, we deprive one person of their freedom and the other one we do not. The reason is obvious: The first driver made a conscious choice to do something, and is therefore must be held responsible for their choice. The second person did not decide to kill a person. Perhaps they were trying to swerve to miss something else, or the pedestrian was wearing black and jaywalking in the middle of the night, or the driver suffered a sudden seizure - there are all kinds of situations where the driver may have done little or nothing wrong. If this is the case, they are a victim of circumstance, and so we don't hold them accountable for the situation they were a part of. Many people believe that fetuses are alive, and that by having sex you are waiving your right to not be pregnant. To them, when you choose to take a risky action it's not permissible to commit murder to get out of dealing with the consequences of that action. However, if you are raped, that's not a situation you chose to be in. You never waived your right to your body. You didn't choose this situation, so your freedom isn't deprived. Yes, a life is still ended, but it wasn't your responsibility to give birth to that child in the first place. Note that I don't agree with that view, but if you accept the premises I gave then the logic makes sense.	0.020548781380057335	0.3710234761238098	0.43187111616134644

I should have said something about it achieving personhood - although even then that's a somewhat nebulous criteria since people can't agree on what gives human life value.Personhood is closer but not correct. As I explained earlier, morality is based off of suffering to pleasure, and autonomy. Those are the only morally relevent factors. What is something immoral you can do to a rock? Nothing, as it does not feel pain and does not have an y will to deprive it of. If I confine someone in prison against their will I am not causing them pain but still violating their autonomy. Suffering/pleasure and autonomy are all that is morally relevent, and all that a being should consider when taking morally significant actions. In the Dec of Indep. moral rights are life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. In hierarchical order because cannot have liberty without life and cannot pursue happiness without liberty. It does not matter whether or not people agree on what gives human life value, those who disagree with what I said are wrong.

It doesn't give a get out of jail free card for pleasure to suffering ratio determining morality exists regardless of whether the circumstance is favorable for the participant. ; I strongly disagree with this. This leads to a number of absurd conclusions. This makes it moral to kill people to harvest their organs. This makes it immoral to take any kind of risk with your children, like bringing them out to go swimming.Not true. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness is a basic guideline. Is life worth living if one does not have any fun on the basis of too much risk? Life is only valuable in that it creates pleasure for the individual alive. Once life stops doing that it is no longer valuable. Taking away someone's life is immoral because it does not allow them to experience pleasure anymore, causes them suffering in the act of it, violates their autonomy, causes suffering for loved ones. On balance, killing people to harvest their organs has more pedagogical effects that are harmful than beneficial and thus not worth it. Although killing one person not beneficial to society in order to save the lives of 5 people would seem moral on a utilitarian basis, on balance a society in which innocent people are killed on the street and have their organs harvested is a society in which greater harms are created than good created by saving lives.	0.333834171295166	0.48119431734085083	0.4491957426071167

The problem is that if we look at the intent of the woman who got pregnant, then we're declaring that what makes abortion immoral is the woman choosing to have sex and not wanting to carry it to term rather than killing the fetus.A more accurate analogy would be to take a pedestrian being hit by a driver and say that if the driver didn't intend to hit them and wasn't doing anything risky they aren't financially or morally responsible for the medical care of the victim and the victim is on their own.

18	t1_dd82hs9	mcstouty		I don't think your analogy is any more accurate. The analogy as written assumes that the driver had no agency whatsoever in being behind the wheel in the first place. By driving the car they are implicitly taking responsibility because they are operating an object that presents a danger to pedestrians regardless of their intended actions. In the case of rape, by definition the woman has no agency: she is the pedestrian in the analogy, not the driver.So then, we have two pedestrians: the woman and the fetus. Now we have to decide whose rights take precedence, but that's outside the scope of the original CMV.Edited to add: I think all of this could be avoided by not shaming people for having sex in the first place. Contraception is accessible to just about everyone (with some sad exceptions) and mistakes happen. Having an abortion can an unpleasant experience to say the least, and if what I've learned from women in my life is true, no woman thinks of abortion as a kind of routine contraception to rely on. Even if it's a moral issue for the woman herself, the world should let it be hers to struggle with and stop trying to force her to feel worse than she already does. In my view, at least until the fetus could reasonably survive outside the womb, it's literally another part of the woman's body, and therefore her own to give up.	0.9651033878326416	0.5431687235832214	0.4893755614757538

You can't quantify these contextual factors in the same way you can the length of a pregnancy, in regards to scientific evidence as to when fetuses can survive outside the womb etc., that may shape a perspective on when a fetus becomes 'human'.	0.004909271374344826	0.005423305556178093	0.004166928585618734

Would she able to care about the child and how would the child react when they find out they are a product of rape.Adoption is always fine, but where is the morality in forcing a person to give birth to their rapists child. What if a couple was planning a pregnancy and it was unknown if the pregnancy was the result of being planned or the rape? Should the couple be forced to raise a child the are unsure is theirs or have an abortion? Again, what happens when that child grows up and begins to wonder where they are from?Morality always changes even with the same immediate consequences. Think of mercy killing/assisted suicide. We put down our pets to stop them from suffering a prolonged death yet there are those that are horrified at the idea of taking someone off life support.	0.9710351824760437	0.7293038964271545	0.3611598312854767
27	t1_dd7hoov	awolz	2.0	Point taken and accepted, the deterioration of the mother's mental health definitely has to be considered as it can also pose a risk to her life ∆. It may very well be immoral to force a woman to continue with a pregnancy, but aborting a fetus (and thus, to some, murdering entirely innocent human life) could be considered so extortionately worse that the emotional pain suffered by the mother (unless it is so much emotional pain that suicide is likely) that this context is largely irrelevant.	0.826513409614563	0.826513409614563	0.17085298895835876

What about the mental health of a person that finds out they were an unwanted pregnancy, hell what about the grandparents -yes even the parents of the rapist can have the right to try and see the child. This is more than just one life in agony.Most people that go for abortions aren't doing so because they were careless, they're doing so after much deliberation because they know they are killing a living thing that has done no harm to them. Choosing to be a \\baby killer\\"" because it is the best choice for ones self and to protect an unborn child from a life of misery (upon finding out they are a rape-baby) is one of the most mature things a person can do. This isn't choosing what to wear in the morning or what to eat, this is a choice regarding lives. Prudence is a large part of morality because it is being mindful of the future.

30	t1_dd7ghug	AnythingApplied	20.0	"&gt; This is seen as justifiable because the motivations of the woman are pure, and she is an innocent party; she is not, for example, rejecting the intrinsic value of an embryo/fetus by treating abortion as a method of contraception.This is different than how I justify it. I don't think being a victim *automatically* entitles you in any way. I also don't believe that having an abortion is ever a completely innocent act. It as always in a moral grey area.It isn't that the individual was a victim of a crime. It is because they did not take any actions of their own free will to sign up for a 9 month emotional rollercoaster that is potentially life-threatening followed by one of the most excruciating pains and 10's of thousands in hospital bills.In any other situation pro-lifers can say, \\You willingly had sex, therefore you must accept the consequences and see the pregnancy to term even if you end up giving the child up for adoption\\"". Rape situations provides less moral ground to the alternative of being forced to see the baby to full term, therefore in comparison, having an abortion is less immoral decision. It is less justifiable to force them to go to full term with the baby since no part of it is their fault."""	0.9611313343048096	0.7052516341209412	0.40830478072166443
31	t1_dd7ggmr	Happy_Laugh_Guy	2.0	OP, I can see from your reply that you're open to considering abortion moral if the mother's life is at stake. If you see physical danger as grounds for terminating a pregnancy, why do you not make a similar allowance for psychological danger. It's not a secret that being raped is harmful to the mental state of individuals. I don't think you can rationally argue, either, that carrying a pregnancy to term that was the result of rape won't have even greater or at least significant psychological implications as well. For real dude. Girl X gets raped and then has to give birth? That would seriously mess somebody up. It can take years of counseling to bounce back from being raped. Imagine how much more damage is done if they have to keep the baby dude.	0.7115779519081116	0.5563037395477295	0.4606313109397888
32	t1_dd7h70i	awolz	2.0	I hadn't hugely considered the possible extent of psychiatric damage, so ∆. If you consider an abortion equal to infanticide, though, the amount of damage an abortion will do is still significantly more than the psychological damage of the mother if she completed her pregnancy. I agree that if the psychological damage is going to pose a real risk to the life of the mother - i.e. her likelihood of suicide is significantly higher - then you can justify abortion in the same way you can justify an abortion that will more directly save the mother's life.	0.0183001309633255	0.2586207389831543	0.4269201457500458
