"t3_5rb7bq"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped. Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me. If someone is trying to rape you, you have a right to defend yourself- even if it leads to the rapist's death. Now I know that rapists and babies/fetuses/embryos are considered different in the sense that one \\"chooses\\" to rape while one is simply brought into existence, but this calls for an acceptance of free will. If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe to attack a person in the same way the baby/embryo/fetus is brought to it's position in the womb. It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified. I like this argument for supporting abortion rights because it works regardless of when an individual believes a person with rights comes into existence."
"t1_dd5wq8l"	"ralph-j"	"24"	"I agree that abortion should be a legal choice, but I think that this is better defended by the bodily integrity argument: no one has the right to force women to stay pregnant against their will. This also works regardless of when the fetus gets human rights, since someone's human rights cannot extend to the use of someone else's body against their will. Saying that you consider it equivalent to rape is not going to convince many people. Referring to sexual consent might be useful as a backup argument in some cases, e.g. one could argue that both staying pregnant and sexual activity require continuous consent."
"t1_dd5zssz"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"Do you think the comparison to rape holds any water?"
"t1_dd61t9c"	"ralph-j"	"27"	"Yes, I'm not saying that it's a weak argument in a logical/rational sense. I'm just saying that you'll have a much harder time using it to convince others."
"t1_dd5zkve"	"mrrp"	"5"	"Self defense is an affirmative defense. To make a claim of self defense, you admit that you are guilty of the elements of the crime, but seek to not be punished due to the circumstances.I do not think that an abortion (let's stick to 1st trimester to keep things simple) needs any sort of self-defense or other affirmative defense to keep it from being a crime.In other words, abortion should be legal simply because it's not illegal, not because we create some sort of exception to a general rule that causing the death of an embryo is criminal behavior."
"t1_dd65zn2"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"my argument is acting under the assumption that the life-form in the womb is equivalent to a person, and that an abortion is essentially a form of manslaughter. In this case however the killing is justified due to a person's right to protect their own interests and well being in the same way a person can defend themselves from a rapist."
"t1_dd68ciq"	"mrrp"	"5"	"In my state, using lethal force in self defense generally requires:1. A reasonable fear of great bodily harm or death.2. That you were a reluctant participant.(and two other things which aren't particularly relevant here)Either you do not allow abortion unless the woman was raped (or can prove contraception failed) AND that the pregnancy poses an immediate threat of great bodily harm or death, or you need to explain why a woman can use deadly force against an embryo to \\"protect her own interests and well being\\", but I can't legally kill the guy who just moved in next door and won't turn down his god damn music at night."
"t1_dd5yzoa"	"phoenixrawr"	"7"	"&gt;Having a person inside you without your consent certainly sounds like rape to me.You're [equivocating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equivocation). \\"Having a person inside you\\" as a sexual euphemism (which without consent would be rape) and literally having a person inside of you are two different things.Lethal self defense is only justified in the US legal system when you can prove that you were at imminent risk of serious injury or loss of life. Most pregnancies don't incur any such risk so a self defense argument for abortion wouldn't hold up to scrutiny."
"t1_dd5zp7m"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The importance of my equivocation is that in order to get the person out of you it may be necessary to use violent self defense. In regards to risk of loss of life, It's important to recognize that it isn't always obvious early in the pregnancy how dangerous the pregnancy is. Perfectly healthy women in normal pregnancies can experience life threatening complications, so the risk of death cannot be ignored."
"t1_dd607q4"	"phoenixrawr"	"7"	"The problem with your equivocation is that you're trying to justify violent self defense with a double meaning - \\"being inside you\\" (sexual penetration) without consent is rape, and violent rape warrants violent self defense, therefore being inside you (pregnancy) also warrants violent self defense. The difference is that rape and sexual assault are potentially violent crimes that can threaten your safety and pregnancy is a natural life process for the fetus that rarely ever poses a serious threat to the mother.You can't justify lethal self defense because \\"it's possible they might be a risk eventually.\\" You can't go to a KKK rally, shoot the place up, and claim that it was self defense because you're black and they might have come to lynch you at some point unless you dealt with them now. The vast majority of pregnancies are safe and healthy so taking violent action against a fetus without a medical opinion confirming that this particular pregnancy is dangerous to carry to term would not be a case of justified self defense."
"t1_dd65ohk"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"Rape is rarely a lethal assault, but it does cause a lot of pain and misery. An unwanted pregnancy can cause just as much pain and misery, so I think the comparison stands.In response to your second point about the kkk rally, i don't think that is a fair comparisson because the physical burden of pregnancy is actual and ongoing, unlike the kkk rally which merely suggests future danger"

"t1_dd5zpy2"	"thisisallme"	NA	"You misunderstand free will. Free will isn't something that you are given or just have, barring any other circumstance. Free will is the ability to do anything you want. It's not fate, it's choosing your actions. You are then \\"defending yourself\\" against either a rapist, who chose to do that, or something that had no decision to even come into being. There's no comparison."
"t1_dd65vso"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"my point is that both the rapist and fetus are where they are and doing what they are doing due to universal circumstances.

"t1_dd5ytpo"	"PikklzForPeepl"	"2"	"&gt; If we recognize free will as simply an illusionThen the whole point of law and the justice system crumbles and is meaningless. If we have no free will, there is no point in discussing this because nothing can be done to change people's views."

If we **recognize** that free will is an illusion then the entire moral and logical basis of law collapses - laws can no more bind my behavior than anything else, because I am unfree and the iron chain of causality forces me to my inevitable end no matter what."
"t1_dd7adms"	"Ohzza"	"1"	"That's a horrifyingly oversimplified view on that. If people have no free will it doesn't magically cut them off from their environment or make them immune to outside factors.In fact if you actually look at that line of reasoning it makes people More able to be influenced in the right ways, which makes a justice system more important."
"t1_dd7p7ny"	"PikklzForPeepl"	"2"	"I'm 100% against the idea that free will doesn't exist. Of course, there are things that influence our decisions in ways that we don't fully understand, but that doesn't mean free will doesn't exist. Our whole concept of justice hinges on free will. \\"Do something bad, and we will do something bad to you\\" is essentially our working definition of justice and a core part of our justice system. We generally don't punish people for things they don't intend to do--If I get sick and then accidentally infect a bunch of other people, I'm not expected to pay their medical bills and I don't receive any punishment. We do punish people for intentional acts or even reckless acts (e.g. careless driving that results in someone's death), but even then there is a difference in how the system defines the crime, and a difference in how we as individuals view the crime. As soon as we get rid of the idea of free will, every criminal could just say, \\"I had no choice,\\" and their crime would fall in the same category as me getting sick and unintentionally infecting other people. I had no choice in the matter... But then you can say that the judge and jury have no choice in the matter either, and will either convict or acquit based on factors that may or may not be actually relevant to the crime... then you wind up in a logic spiral where nobody is responsible for their actions. Even if it somehow is true, it's dangerous to base a system off of that."
"t1_dd7s0d4"	"Ohzza"	"1"	"Well that's the difference between free will and accountability. It's basically the \\"if there's no just afterlife why behave good\\" thing to me.But the way I see the free will debate isn't that we don't have responsibility. The way I define it is if you genetically similar or identical people under identical environments they will turn out and act exactly the same up until they are exposed to different things than each other. They would all be accountable for their actions, and should be rewarded or punished accordingly.This also pushes the justice systems focus towards recompensation and reform, instead of purely being punitive. As in if someone was brought up to have criminal mindsets they can be reconditioned to be an asset to society.But this is of course talking about Libertarian Free Will, which I feel lends itself to more supernatural origins of human agency. I don't discount agency, and even from a purely scientific view find the only ethical solution is to find it a sacred human right."
"t1_dd5vbk3"	"Telynor"	"8"	"If your contention is that the law should be based on a presumption that there is no such thing as free will, then there should be no such thing as criminal law.

"t1_dd5w7y6"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"sure, it just means that criminals need a penal system that can either reform their behavior or separate them from vulnerable members of society.

"t1_dd6d0sc"	"TrulySleekZ"	NA	"By your logic, birthing complications that end up killing the mother could be considered manslaughter, for which the baby could spend two years in Juvi, which I think everyone can agree is ridiculous. Giving a child that young any kind of responsibility over it's own actions is not really feasible. It can't make any sort of decisions about what it's doing and why. Suggesting that it can, for me, would make abortions seem worse. Now, instead of ending a life before it begins, you are killing a rational, thinking being."
"t1_dd669kx"	"Negative_Nil"	"1"	"By your logic, the only difference between having sex with someone and raping them is that in one case I believe it is consensual and in the other I believe it is not. But as I have no free will then I can't be blamed for having sex without consent as it was predestined, and I too had as much choice as the victim. The physical act is the same in both cases and if we \\"recognise free will as simply an illusion\\" then rape isn't a crime. As such it shouldn't be legal to kill a rapist and therefore abortions should be illegal too.... according to your line of reasoning.At the core, your argument is that 'Mens Rea' the guilty mind shouldn't be recognised in law. To do so would be insane. In fact the idea of insanity itself no longer exists as it is based on the idea of a compromised mind which no longer matters. To say intent and premeditation are irrelevant because free will is an illusion is as valid as saying all guilty acts are irrelevant because nobody had the free will to do them and we shouldn't be held accountable for anything because it was all predetermined."
"t1_dd66wdi"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The difference between sex and rape is that one is desired and consented and the other is not. I don't believe in blaming or lauding people for their actions because they cannot help it. I do believe in having a system of law and justice that can reduce and prevent suffering. Thus crime and justice still exists and is relevant for the sake of protecting people, regardless of the origin of crime being a person who has the freedom to act or a person who is slave to their biology and circumstance.I don't think I am calling into question Mens Rea, but I admit not fully understanding the concept. I'd like to hear more about how this is relevant."
"t1_dd6qiig"	"Negative_Nil"	"1"	"Lets just look at this one central element of what you said.; If we recognize free will as simply an illusion, then the rapist is equally forced by the determined circumstances of the universe Free will is an illusion and all acts are determined circumstances of the universe.You aren't justifying abortion with this sentence as you seem to think you are. You are excusing rape. You are saying that it isn't the rapist fault in the same way that it isn't the fetus' fault. As it is already determined to happen because free will is an illusion. But because you know rape is wrong and in your mind you have now equated the two acts you feel justified in saying that this means killing the fetus is okay.Using the idea that free will is an illusion then whenever the question of Mens Rea comes up it can instantly be said that the lack of free will means they had no guilty mind as they weren't capable of controlling their actions.**Whether free will exists or not, you have to accept that it does to have a functioning legal system, or it becomes an excuse for all evil acts.**"

"t1_dd61ldo"	"uyoos2uyoos2"	"2"	"I would argue that self-defense doesn't apply because of the very important concept of premeditation. Most self-defense laws assume that you are using lethal force to combat the threat of imminent harm. However, let's say hypothetically somebody who is incapable of telling a lie sent you a letter and said \\"Sometime in the next 9 months I am going to kill and/or rape you\\". You would not, at that point, make an appointment on your calendar to go to that person's house to go kill them. Now where the parallel works are when the baby threatens immediate injury to your person and a medical decision needs to be made. If you were qualified and capable of diagnosing the medical situation, you would not be liable for the death of even a 5 monther if you were somewhere in the woods and had to somehow self-perform an abortion to save your own life. I'm not taking a position on abortion at all - I think I'm really just addressing the aptness of your analogy to the conversation."
"t1_dd66i0u"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"The concept of pre-meditation is not one I have fully considered, and I'd like to hear more about it's role here.One point I'd like to make that makes the hypothetical of the \\"i am going to hurt you in the next 9 months\\" a bit off-base is that the burden of pregnancy is actual and ongoing, not hypothetically going to occur but actually occurring on a constant basis throughout the term.There is threat of immediate and ongoing pain, discomfort, nausea, weight gain, immobility etc. So i think the option of self defense is still relevant."
"t1_dd8q574"	"uyoos2uyoos2"	"2"	"&gt; is that the burden of pregnancy is actual and ongoing, not hypothetically going to occur So in terms of the law there are two things I will point out. The term \\"burden\\" isn't necessarily the same as the term \\"harm\\". While I have never been pregnant (or even had period cramps) I think the argument for pregnancy pain is that it's somewhere above \\"discomfort\\" and somewhere below \\"harm\\". Having said this the operative definition of justified retaliation is doing so under undue harm. The pain and burden experienced during presidency not being undue, given the circumstances. I will also speak to the \\"hypothetically going to occur\\" argument. The law recognizes, and I think for good reason, that the undue stress inflicted on a person from a death threat. In this sense, the stress may not be physical but it is ongoing in much the same way as a pregnancy is. However neither is enough to allow for lethal force."

You want laws protecting abortion, yet you don't recognize free will? If you are a determinist, then laws don't matter.Without free will, there are no morals. (Because we are not free to choose right or wrong.) Without morals, there are no laws.How do you justify the need for laws when we are (in your view) already determined?*****; I know it sounds weird, but being pregnant when you don't want to be is essentially the same as being raped.It sounds weird because you're taking a state of being (pregnancy) brought about a certain action (sex) that the woman consented to and comparing it to an action that the woman did not consent to (rape).They are *essentially* different and cannot be equated like this in an argument.*****; It then seems logical that defending oneself from a rapist and defending oneself from an unwanted pregnancy are equally justified.One defends from a rapist by preventing an immoral act. Abortion is not *preventing* a pregnancy, it is *ending* one.Unwanted pregnancies are 100% prevented by not having sex and prevented with high probability with birth control. Sex always has some risk of pregnancy. So if a woman chooses to have sex, she has accepted that risk. Wishing that consequence didn't happen does not remove the consequence or remove the moral responsibility from the person."

If a fetus was a person capable of feeling pain and experiencing emotions the way that a baby is, than i would feel a lot more conflicted about abortions and find them morally difficult to justify in most cases. I feel that this distinction is really important to make and shouldn't be put aside. I can't help but feel that your argument about self defence equates fetuses with persons. For example, laws about self defence don't include defending yourself against a bear, because a bear is not considered a person and it's life is not legally protected in the way that a human's is. I believe that abortion should be legal on the grounds that human beings have the right to bodily atonomy, and a fetus (in the first two trimesters anyways) should not have any rights of it's own yet because it is not a person."

"t1_dd6bp0p"	"_participation"	"1"	"In principle, I agree, but would add the following caveats.**The only permissible self-defence is the use of the minimum force necessary to stop the 'attack'**Laws on self-defence generally require proportionality between the threat posed and the steps taken to stop the threat, i.e. that the force used in self-defence be no more than is necessary to stop the threat. This is not only often true as a matter of posited law, but must be so in principle because, by definition, the conduct which is engaged in as a matter of self-defence would, but for the fact that it is done in self-defence, itself amount to an offence. You would therefore need to show that killing the 'attacker' is a proportionate response to the 'attack'. You attempt to do this by drawing an analogy with an attack by a rapist. You rightly point out that the right of self-defence against a rapist can, in principle, extend to causing death. It does not follow, however, that the right *always* extends this far. If, for example, on the facts, a mere punch is sufficient to stop the rapist, then the right of self-defence extends only to punching, and not to killing. It follows from the reason why the proportionality requirement exists that 'proportionality' refers to the minimum force required to stop the 'attack'. It does not refer to proportionality between the force used in self-defence and the severity of the 'attack'. Thus, for example, if the 'attack' is a hard punch, and a light slap is enough to stop the 'attack', then the right of self-defence permits the attacked person only to slap and not to punch. The severity of the 'attack' is not in question. Given these preliminary points, one argue that the minimum force that can be inflicted on the 'attacker' in order to stop the 'attack' is death because, in the case of a baby/foetus/embryo, there is simply no other step that it is possible to take in self-defence. The question is therefore whether the proportionality requirement demands that the force used in self-defence must be the minimum that would *conceivably* stop the 'attack', or the minimum that is *physically possible* and would stop the 'attack'. To argue in favour of abortion rights on the ground of self-defence, you must commit yourself to the latter view.**The maximum force possible in self-defence must be proportionate to the severity of the 'attack'**The more difficult set of questions to ask concerns how far the severity of the self-defence can exceed the severity of the 'attack'. For example, it intuitively sounds more justifiable to kill to stop a rapist than it is to kill to stop a puncher, because the difference in severity between raping and killing is larger than the difference in severity between punching and killing. The question would then become: what is the difference in severity between the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo on the one hand, and killing on the other? This requires an account of what interest is violated by the baby/foetus/embryo. I do not now propose to provide one; I only seek to argue that one is needed. In general, however, you would need to show that the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo is severe in nature. It would not be enough to show that the 'attack' is a violation of bodily integrity, or takes place without the consent of the attacked person: so would, say, be being slapped. You would thus need an account of the interests violated by being pregnant (let us put aside for now the interests violated after the baby is born) that goes beyond merely saying that being physically affected against one's will is itself such a violation. To put it somewhat crudely, imagine there is a scale (A) of types of attack, ranging from slapping, to punching, to raping. Parallel to scale A is a scale (B) of the *maximum* permissible defences against each attack. You have argued that rape on scale A corresponds to killing on scale B. What I have posited in the previous paragraph is that slapping on scale A does not correspond to killing on scale B; perhaps it corresponds to, say, punching on scale B. Your question therefore ought to be: what on scale B corresponds to the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo on scale A?You seem to argue that the answer is killing, on the grounds that: (a) killing on scale B corresponds to rape on scale A; (b) the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo is analogous to rape because it is a non-consensual violation of bodily integrity. The trouble with that is that *everything* on scale A is a non-consensual violation of bodily integrity. Your account of the harm done by the baby's/foetus's/embryo's 'attack' therefore needs to be more detailed than that."

"t1_dd6x8ww"	"aRabidGerbil"	"2"	"Mental anguish that pushes a mother to suicide is definitely something I'd call a life threatening complication.That being said I would say that the first step would be therapy not abortion, if a trained therapist believes that the mother's life is in danger then that's very different than just a claim from the mother"
"t1_dd710rm"	"sophistry13"	"1"	"I agree with you. That's a really good point. I agree that all people who consider abortion should have access to counselling and psychiatric help. At least here in the UK and I'm guessing the US too, mental health services are massively underfunded so that help often falls to charities rather than the free health service here."
"t1_dd71mf1"	"aRabidGerbil"	"2"	"While mental health should be better funded that doesn't effect the consideration of self defense.If some said \\"I was being bullied to the point of committing suicide so I killed the bully\\" that doesn't absolve them of the killing it just points the need for mental healthcare"
"t1_dd73237"	"jessebanjo"	NA	"this is very good point. Kids who are bullied everyday and eventually snap back with lethal violence are usually prosecuted to the extreme extent of the law. In the sense that the mental anguish associated with unwanted pregnancy is similar to bullying, I can see how resorting to lethal violence is unjustified. However, a major difference here is that there are multiple ways to stop bullying, including parent/teacher interventions or changing school systems. The only possible ways to end the mental anguish of pregnancy is an abortion or extensive counseling to the point of changing the mother's mind about what they want to do. Since extensive therapy is a theoretical alternative to the abortion, I suppose that it should be attempted first. However, I think that there are a lot of messy details about how far therapy can go in changing the mind of the mother before it goes too far. therefore I still think that the use of lethal force as the only possible method to end the suffering of the mother is justified"
