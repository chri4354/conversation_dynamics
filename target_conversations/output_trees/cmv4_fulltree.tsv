1	t1_dd5wq8l	ralph-j	24.0	I agree that abortion should be a legal choice, but I think that this is better defended by the bodily integrity argument: no one has the right to force women to stay pregnant against their will. This also works regardless of when the fetus gets human rights, since someone's human rights cannot extend to the use of someone else's body against their will. Saying that you consider it equivalent to rape is not going to convince many people. Referring to sexual consent might be useful as a backup argument in some cases, e.g. one could argue that both staying pregnant and sexual activity require continuous consent.	0.49623262882232666	0.497883141040802	0.49646466970443726

43	t1_dd6bp0p	_participation	1.0	In principle, I agree, but would add the following caveats.**The only permissible self-defence is the use of the minimum force necessary to stop the 'attack'**Laws on self-defence generally require proportionality between the threat posed and the steps taken to stop the threat, i.e. that the force used in self-defence be no more than is necessary to stop the threat. This is not only often true as a matter of posited law, but must be so in principle because, by definition, the conduct which is engaged in as a matter of self-defence would, but for the fact that it is done in self-defence, itself amount to an offence. You would therefore need to show that killing the 'attacker' is a proportionate response to the 'attack'. You attempt to do this by drawing an analogy with an attack by a rapist. You rightly point out that the right of self-defence against a rapist can, in principle, extend to causing death. It does not follow, however, that the right *always* extends this far. If, for example, on the facts, a mere punch is sufficient to stop the rapist, then the right of self-defence extends only to punching, and not to killing. It follows from the reason why the proportionality requirement exists that 'proportionality' refers to the minimum force required to stop the 'attack'. It does not refer to proportionality between the force used in self-defence and the severity of the 'attack'. Thus, for example, if the 'attack' is a hard punch, and a light slap is enough to stop the 'attack', then the right of self-defence permits the attacked person only to slap and not to punch. The severity of the 'attack' is not in question. Given these preliminary points, one argue that the minimum force that can be inflicted on the 'attacker' in order to stop the 'attack' is death because, in the case of a baby/foetus/embryo, there is simply no other step that it is possible to take in self-defence. The question is therefore whether the proportionality requirement demands that the force used in self-defence must be the minimum that would *conceivably* stop the 'attack', or the minimum that is *physically possible* and would stop the 'attack'. To argue in favour of abortion rights on the ground of self-defence, you must commit yourself to the latter view.**The maximum force possible in self-defence must be proportionate to the severity of the 'attack'**The more difficult set of questions to ask concerns how far the severity of the self-defence can exceed the severity of the 'attack'. For example, it intuitively sounds more justifiable to kill to stop a rapist than it is to kill to stop a puncher, because the difference in severity between raping and killing is larger than the difference in severity between punching and killing. The question would then become: what is the difference in severity between the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo on the one hand, and killing on the other? This requires an account of what interest is violated by the baby/foetus/embryo. I do not now propose to provide one; I only seek to argue that one is needed. In general, however, you would need to show that the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo is severe in nature. It would not be enough to show that the 'attack' is a violation of bodily integrity, or takes place without the consent of the attacked person: so would, say, be being slapped. You would thus need an account of the interests violated by being pregnant (let us put aside for now the interests violated after the baby is born) that goes beyond merely saying that being physically affected against one's will is itself such a violation. To put it somewhat crudely, imagine there is a scale (A) of types of attack, ranging from slapping, to punching, to raping. Parallel to scale A is a scale (B) of the *maximum* permissible defences against each attack. You have argued that rape on scale A corresponds to killing on scale B. What I have posited in the previous paragraph is that slapping on scale A does not correspond to killing on scale B; perhaps it corresponds to, say, punching on scale B. Your question therefore ought to be: what on scale B corresponds to the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo on scale A?You seem to argue that the answer is killing, on the grounds that: (a) killing on scale B corresponds to rape on scale A; (b) the 'attack' by the baby/foetus/embryo is analogous to rape because it is a non-consensual violation of bodily integrity. The trouble with that is that *everything* on scale A is a non-consensual violation of bodily integrity. Your account of the harm done by the baby's/foetus's/embryo's 'attack' therefore needs to be more detailed than that.	0.16476452350616455	0.37635716795921326	0.4043300151824951

I cannot morally stand by while watching an attacker commit a deadly assault on a woman. I have to step in and stop the attacker. If the woman is hurt while I am attempting to stop her lethal attacker, although regrettable, I know that I am free of liability under Good Samaritan laws.tl;dr I can walk around punching pregnant women in the stomach.	0.004850101191550493	0.03888920694589615	0.07181493937969208

I am hesitant to accept your argument because the degree of physical discomfort, and cost of a pregnancy is really hard to estimate.

53	t1_dd6pl9o	sophistry13	1.0	Out of interest what would you think about mental anguish to the point where the mother would commit suicide due to the pregnancy? Is it permissible then? If so, how do you bar all women from just lying about that and claiming they are mentally unstable? I think in my country at least almost all abortions are put down as impacting the mental health of the mother. Just because simply not wanting the child and being forced to go through with it against their will is causing mental anguish. It'd be tricky to try to prove that one person was lying about wanting to commit suicide in that situation though.	0.9610508680343628	0.8149523138999939	0.32206279039382935

57	t1_dd73237	jessebanjo		this is very good point. Kids who are bullied everyday and eventually snap back with lethal violence are usually prosecuted to the extreme extent of the law. In the sense that the mental anguish associated with unwanted pregnancy is similar to bullying, I can see how resorting to lethal violence is unjustified. However, a major difference here is that there are multiple ways to stop bullying, including parent/teacher interventions or changing school systems. The only possible ways to end the mental anguish of pregnancy is an abortion or extensive counseling to the point of changing the mother's mind about what they want to do. Since extensive therapy is a theoretical alternative to the abortion, I suppose that it should be attempted first. However, I think that there are a lot of messy details about how far therapy can go in changing the mind of the mother before it goes too far. therefore I still think that the use of lethal force as the only possible method to end the suffering of the mother is justified	0.6986023187637329	0.5493350625038147	0.4497557282447815
