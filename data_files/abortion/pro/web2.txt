After the Atlantic hired Kevin Williamson, NARAL launched a campaign to #FireKevin, due to his advocacy for capital punishment for anyone who’s had an abortion. Following reports that Williamson is no longer at the Atlantic, NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue issued the following statement:

“Women’s health, wellbeing, and rights are under near-constant attack, yet men like Kevin Williamson are given the benefit of the doubt, second chances, and national platforms. Extremists like Williamson deserve condemnation, not a byline to espouse racist, misogynist, right wing extremism.

“One in four women will have an abortion, something that the majority of Americans support as an option and something Kevin Williamson believes should be punishable by death. Williamson’s statements are cruel and dangerous in the current climate. That’s why NARAL members spoke out and petitioned The Atlantic to fire extremist bigot Kevin Williamson.

“While the Atlantic should have never allowed him to occupy space in its pages, we’re relieved that Jeffrey Goldberg heard the concerns and outrage of so many and removed Williamson from his post.”

Over 50,000 activists called for Williamson’s removal.

NARAL Pro-Choice America and its network of state affiliates are dedicated to protecting and expanding reproductive freedom for all Americans. NARAL works to guarantee that every woman has the right to make personal decisions regarding the full range of reproductive choices, including preventing unintended pregnancy, bearing healthy children, and choosing legal abortion. In recognition of its work defending our constitutional right to choose, Fortune Magazine described NARAL as “one of the top 10 advocacy groups in America.”
